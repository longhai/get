When on the court the player always plays towards the right of the court. First the player tries to get the ball from a throw by a well timed button press. When the player has the ball the player has the option to move, pass the ball, and jump. When jumping the player can shoot, with the accuracy of the shot depending on the timing, or just simply pass.

There are a few penalties that the player can get including but not limited to Travelling (not passing after jumping), Charging (Sometimes called when the player with the ball runs into an opponent), and Pushing (Sometimes called when the player without the ball runs into an opponent) with all the penalties resulting with the other team getting the ball on the side of the court."

Con-dori is an arcade style game where you control a mother bird defending her eggs from enemies. Your foes arrive from the right of the screen in balloons, and fire missiles at you. By flying into the right spot on the front or rear of the balloon with your beak, you can pop it. If a balloon successfully makes it to the tree with your nest, it will drop a section of ladder. Once three sections of ladder have been dropped, subsequent balloons will drop climbers. These make their way up the ladder and, unless they are knocked off with a precise peck to the back, will take an egg once they pass your nest.

Popping ten balloons on a levels takes you to the next stage. This resets your power, and clears away incomplete sections of ladder. Subsequent levels have faster and more rapidly firing balloons. The game continues until you eventually lose, which can happen in two ways. You can lose all of your lives, either to enemy fire or by running out of power. Or you can lose all of your eggs to the voracious enemy."

The game was released in 2009 for MSX family home computers, in 2020 it received a fan port for the 8-bit Sega Master System console.

This story takes place in the year 2059. Since the Earth's limited resources have been wasted by the human race, new energy sources had to be found out of the planet.

After several years of investigation, a group of scientists discovered new minerals under the crust of Jupiter moons. Those minerals turned out to be a great energy source, that's why a large scale exploitation was planned from Earth. So the Power Afield Company (P.A.C.) was founded in order to create 5 automatic driller robots called Drilleroids designed to carry out all the work without need of human intervention.

The Drilleroids were sent to Jupiter and started to work successfully. Nevertheless, unexpected troubles came up: there was life under the crust of Jupiter moons... small beings which felt threatened by the presence of the Drilleroids and attacked them causing serious damage.

A space mission manned by a team of experienced astronauts was launched to repair the Drilleroids and equip them with a self-defense system to avoid future attacks. This mission was called J.E.T.P.A.C. (Jupiter Elite Troop Power Afield Company).

They completed their duty and returned to the spaceship willing to return to Earth. Sadly, they found out it had invaded Jupiter's asteroid belt, receiving several serious impacts: the main power generator and the transmission systems were damaged. The team was condemned to die, resting forever around Jupiter's orbit.

Suddenly, they came up with a desperate way to save their lives: to obtain the energy modules from the Drilleroids with the hope they could generate enough power to reactivate the spaceship... but after installing the self-defense systems and not being able to disable them by radio, there is no option but fighting the Drilleroids to snatch their energy modules."

A key feature of NBA Jam was the exaggerated nature of the play - players jumped many times above their own height, making slam dunks that defied both human capabilities and the laws of physics. There were no fouls, free throws, or violations except goaltending and 24 second violations. This meant the player was able to freely shove or elbow his opponent out of the way. Additionally, the game had an ""on fire"" feature, where if one player made three baskets in a row, he would become ""on fire"" and have unlimited turbo, no goaltending, and increased shooting ability, until the other team scored (or the player had scored four consecutive baskets while ""on fire"")."

Roughly half of the home ports are called Nemesis while the others stick with Gradius, the reasons for the change not being fully understood.

The Master System version of the game is identical to the MSX version, running in the graphics mode intended for SG-1000 backwards compatibility. As a result the gameplay is significantly more choppy than its arcade counterpart, and the graphics do not take advantage of the Master System hardware."

The unofficially licensed game had been unknown until a Wikipedia page was created in September 2006. 

There are over 15 levels in the game. All of them involve problem solving and for every problem solved your character will move forward eventually reaching the end of the screen and clearing the stage. Your opponent varies depending on the speed setting set at the options screen. For example, if you choose Snail you will race a Moto Bug, but when hare is selected you will race a much faster Rabbit, and the time limit is decreased.

Most of the levels involve find the word puzzles where you have to spell out a word using the available letters. These levels are sometimes interrupted by a match the letters segment, where you must find a certain amount of matching letters among the available letters shown onscreen. The match the letters segment is somewhat broken because sometimes no matching letters are ever shown, or actually matching the letters may give a wrong answer anyway. In those cases you have to select the wrong answer to get the right answer.

Other levels involve solving mathematical equations: addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication."

"Street Fighter II","","Region Not Set","","Tec Toy Indústria de Brinquedos S.A.","Capcom","1997-09-01","2","No","Fighting","T - Teen","Street Fighter II′ is an 8-bit version of Capcom's revolutionary arcade fighting game Street Fighter II to the Sega Master System by TecToy in 1997. It is not a port of any specific version of Street Fighter II, but rather it is a mix between the Mega Drive versions of Street Fighter II': Special Champion Edition and Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers, mixing elements from both. The title itself, Street Fighter II′, features the same blue fonts as the Champion Edition logo, as well as the prime symbol (′) next to the numeral, which is pronounced Dash in Japan, but is usually unspoken overseas.

Though severely watered down due to the weaker hardware of the SMS, this version of Street Fighter II is still a reasonably faithful rendition of the game. It also features the announcer's vocals which the Mega Drive's Special Champion Edition lacked. However, the game is held back by a lack of moves (the Master System only has two buttons on its controller, as opposed to the six used in the arcade game) and character voice samples, and the framerate is low. The music has also been tweaked in places.

The SMS version only retains 8 fighters out of the 12 character roster from Special Champion Edition. E. Honda, Zangief, Dhalsim and Vega (Claw) are the four fighters who did not made the cut. None of the additional fighters from New Challengers (Cammy, T. Hawk, Fei-Long and Dee-Jay) are present either, despite the use of character portraits from that version.

The character-specific endings are also not present in this version either: instead the ending screen consists of portraits of Balrog, Sagat and M. Bison (the same ones used in Special Champion Edition when the player clears the game using a boss character) with a generic message underneath. The staff roll is also lifted straight from Special Champion Editon, but with the addition of people who worked specifically on this version."

"In The Wake of Vampire (イン ザ ウエイク オブ ヴァンパイア)","Vampire: Master of Darkness | Master of Darkness","NTSC-J","Japan","Sega | 																Sims Co., Ltd.","Sims","1992-10-23","1","No","Action | Platform","M - Mature 17+","Master of Darkness, known in Japan as In the Wake of Vampire (イン ザ ウエイク オブ ヴァンパイア) and in the United States as Vampire: Master of Darkness, is a Sega Game Gear action platform game developed by SIMS. Highly derivative of the 1986 Konami game Castlevania, it was first published in Japan by the developer themselves in October 1992 (a week before Halloween), and was brought to the United States, Europe, and Brazil the following year. Later in July 2012, developer M2 ported the Game Gear version to the Nintendo 3DS' Virtual Console service.

In 1993, the same developer ported Master of Darkness to the Sega Master System, where it retained its original name.

The soundtrack of Master of Darkness was composed by Takashi Horiguchi and Yoko Wada. Like the rest of the game, the music bears obvious similarities to songs of Castlevania. The music has an ominous and sinister feel to it.

The plot has the player entering the role of a Ouija board-playing psychologist named Dr. Ferdinand Social, who is looking to defeat Count Dracula, who is behind a series of killings in London that have been attributed to Jack the Ripper. However, Jack the Ripper is indeed responsible, for he is using the victim's bodies and fresh blood for sacrificial offerings – as part of a dark ritual being performed by Count Massen to resurrect Dracula. Also taking some part in the murders and the dark ritual is a mysterious Psychic Girl, who is possessed by an evil Skull Spirit.

The game requires the player to battle their way through five rounds, which are divided into three lengthy stages. The rounds consists of the Thames River, House of Wax, a Cemetery that leads to Count Massen's Castle, a laboratory within Massen's Castle, and finally being teleported to a dungeon-like Labyrinth within Castle Dracula, which resides in a forest of Transylvania. At the end of each round is a boss, a person with connection to the murders and dark ritual who must be defeated. The bosses are Jack the Ripper, a Psychic Girl possessed by a Skull Spirit, Count Massen, performer of the rituals, and finally Dracula himself.
