One of the more notable players in the game is Shunsuke Nakamura  who played for Tōkō Gakuen High School.

The game has some similarities with Hat Trick Hero, Aoki Densetsu Shoot! or any other soccer game with the left-right perspective, and Top Striker or Libero Grande because of the ability to play as just one player, instead of controlling the whole team. This feature would serve as a model for the ""career mode"" provided in most modern EA Sports games. There were many other improvements over the two original versions. One of the most important being the availability of creating and customizing an own character/football player and training with the instructor before each match, among other options. Coaches give out verbal reports that range between ""perfect"" and ""needs improvement.""

This game is a sequel to Zenkoku Kōkō Soccer and Zenkoku Kōkō Soccer 2."

The premise is that each world represents a different season — there's a Spring world, a Summer world, a Fall world, and a Winter world. (And some more!)

The core gameplay doesn't stray too far from the original Super Mario World, but almost all of the assets have been changed, and all are custom-made for this hack. I made all the graphics myself (which isn't often done), and some very kind people from the community have put together an original soundtrack. There's also a lot of custom programming done, which I partially did myself, but also relied heavily on code resources from the community and many talented hackers lending a helping hand along the way."

"A Very Super Mario World","","NTSC","United States of America","","","2017-05-21","1","No","Platform | Unofficial","Not Rated","Super Mario World has been around since my child hood. Super Mario Bros. 1 was my very first video game and I grew up on Super Mario Bros 3 and thought it was the best thing ever. I really don't remember when I first played Super Mario World but it wasn't until a long, long while after I played Super Mario Bros 3 (at that point I already had Super Mario All Stars) However, probably over a decade later after having played it, I'm still playing it, and still loving it. I don't think I'll ever outgrow classic Mario platforming. That's probably why I liked SMW hacks so much. I'd play a ton of them, even long after normal people likely would have gotten bored since a lot of hacks are still basically Super Mario World.

I've made no attempt to really set myself apart to that end, because when it comes down to it, that's what I'm here for; classic Mario platforming. Back during a time when we were actually excited to rescue the Princess again. Back during a time when we could separate levels by world and the levels told you what world they belonged to. Back during a time where there weren't any funky control gimmicks, weird goals or anything that distracted you from the overall feel that it was a Mario game, nothing more, nothing less. Just straight up run, jump, shoot fireballs, swing your cape, stomp on enemies and stuff like that. I've made this hack with that in mind, it's nothing but classic Mario platforming. Don't expect anything flashy, both on part of that and on part of my general inexperience and laziness in hacking.

There are eight primary worlds, an extra world, a star world that connects various places, and a special, secret world that will test your mettle (and patience.) The goal of every level is to reach the end, and possibly fight a boss such as a koopaling once you do. Many levels have secret exits that are usually opened by taking a key to a keyhole, as per usual Super Mario World fare. There's many features and gimmicks to many levels, but the feeling of classic Mario platforming typically stays the same. The story is always the same; Mario goes on an adventure to save his friends and the Princess from the evil King Bowser, and along the way jumps, shoots and even flies through the land in search of the castles controlled by Bowser's underlings."

It was ported to Nintendo Super Famicom in 1992.

In the year 2100, the Earth's environment is devastated by its inhabitants, who develop their space technology to live on Mars. Before they left, the humans created a Bio-Computer assigned to replenish Earth's ecosystem in hopes of returning to Earth. 50 years after terra-forming parts of Mars, the human colonists were attacked by mysterious, but hostile UFOs. The military leaders among the colonists set up an attack force to defend the colonists using state of the art fighter ships identified as the Icarus. The main operation of attack is called ""Acrobat Mission"" because it exceeds the technical flying ability of the pilots.
In the arcade version, surviving fighter pilots Jet and Nova are available for the player to choose for the rest of the game, but both were discluded from the Super Famicom port, making the player's pilot anonymous as well as discarding Nova's custom color scheme.
Here however is the story, exactly as it appears at the beginning of the game, with spelling and grammar mistakes preserved:
""AD 2100: HUMANS EXTERMINATED BY THEIR OWN NATURE DISTRUPTION AND ESCAPE TO MARS LEAVING BIO-COMPUTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL RECUPERATION OF EARTH. ONE DAY HALF A CENTURY AFTER HUMANS ARRIVED, MARS WAS ATTACKED BY STRANGE FLYING OBJECTES. TO FIGHT THESE ENEMIES, THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF THE DEFENCE AGENCY ORGANIZED THE TASK FORCE ARMY AND STARTED THE DOG FIGHT WITH INVADERS QUICLY. THE OPERATION WAS CALLED ""ACROBAT MISSION"" AS IT EXCEEDED THE PILOT'S TECHNICAL LIMIT.""

Players started the game equipped with the default weapon, the Standard Shot: a semi-automatic laser weapon. Though moderately powerful, the Standard Shot cannot be upgraded or charged. Once the player has lost a significant number of lives and their selected weapon his lost its upgrades, the Standard Shot will once again take over.
Two other weapons are selectable to the player, one of which is the Wave Shot (announced as Wide in the Arcade version). The Wave Shot is a spread shot that increases in size, numbers and strength. When charged, the Wave Shot can unleash a short range, but powerful laser blast that increases in width and strength when Wave icons are collected. The other weapon was the Hurricane Shot, a unique area-effect weapon that encircles the ship clockwise when fired before flying forward. When charged, the Hurricane Shot fires a ball of energy across the screen, but there is a one second delay every time the shot is fired.
The player also had Bombs although unlike many shooters, the player can only hold up to two bombs. Once collected however, the two bombs get physically mounted under the ship's wings. If an enemy shot hits one of the bombs, then the bomb will detonate, creating a destructive shield for the player. The player can manually detonate either bomb at will.
The player's Icarus fighter ship has a number of defenses at its disposal as well. Whenever the player moves their ship in any given direction, a burst of flame from the ship's jet exhaust will shoot out from the opposite direction the player moves the ship in. This applies to all directions: left, right, front, back and all four diagonal angles. This jet exhaust not only serves an aesthetic purpose, but it can also harm nearby enemies and destroy nearby objects.
Whenever the player is hit, their ship will steer wildly out of control. Once this happens, a timer will appear near the ship which indicates how long the ship has until it explodes. The explosion of the player's ship will harm any nearby enemies. Also, because the Icarus is apparently well built, any kamikaze enemies or drifting objects that touch it will not damage or destroy the player's ship, allowing the player less restrictive movement."

Aeron's Golden Cookie Quest is an old-school styled hack, that has inpiration in various video games including: Kirby, Mega Man, Castlevania, Ganbare Goemon, Shinobi, Mario and others. Instead of inspiring myself in any hack creator, I wanted to make this project as a love letter for videogames and I plan to achieve that with this hack.

It's a weird hybrid of traditional and chocolate. While this hack has a lot of ASM, its level design is more focused all in tackling obstacles than innovative level design. I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel or anything, just to be clear, so don't go with the wrong expectations, when playing this hack. Much like an old game, it has some bullshit moments, but a lot of good and rewarding gameplay.

This hack has lore, but it's not too wordy or too wacky. It's very easy to understand. Slightly inspired by The Second Reality Project 2 Reloaded."

A-Train III is the first game in the series to make use of near-isometric dimetric projection to present the city, similar to Maxis's SimCity 2000. There are two types of transport that the player's company can take: passengers or building materials. The former is more likely to be profitable, but building materials allow the city to grow. Wherever the building materials are delivered, they can be taken and used to construct buildings for the city. These start with houses, but eventually, as an area grows, roads, and shops and other buildings are built. These can provide extra revenue for a passenger service, but also allowing the city to develop and grow can be seen as a goal in itself. As well as the buildings built by the computer, in response to the materials being present, the player can construct their own buildings, such as ski resorts and hotels, and make profits from them if the conditions are right."

It concerns an office worker who is prompted to look into the apparent suicide of a girl from his childhood after receiving a weird phone call asking for help and a vivid dream about her. He returns to the mysterious mountain shrine where she was reported to have burned to death.

The game was originally released for the Super Famicom in 1995 and later saw enhanced ports for the Sony PlayStation in 1999 (with the subtitle Fukkatsusai, or ""Easter"") and Windows PCs in 2001 (with the subtitle Kanzenban, or ""Perfect Edition"")."

It is the eighth entry in the Castlevania series, and the first of two Castlevania games released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System console. In Japan, the game is simply known as Akumajō Dracula - this title was chosen in order to signify a ""back to basics"" approach for the series.[1] The game was released in Japan on October 31, 1991, in North America on December 4, 1991, and in Europe on November 23, 1992.

The game has been re-released several times over the years. It was re-released on the Virtual Console in 2006 for the Wii, in 2013 for the Wii U, and in 2016 for the New Nintendo 3DS. In September 2017, it was included on Nintendo's Super NES Classic Edition in North America and Europe but was not part of the list in Japan. The game is also included in the cross-platform Castlevania Anniversary Collection, released on May 17, 2019.

As a result of the above mentioned ""back to basics"" approach, the game recycles the basic plot and protagonist of the original Castlevania released on the Nintendo Entertainment System: Count Dracula has awoken from a 100-year slumber and vampire hunter Simon Belmont sets out to seal him away once again. However, the game features entirely new levels and enemies, as well as an almost completely original soundtrack. Therefore, the game can be considered to be a wholly separate entry in the Castlevania franchise."

After she rightfully regained her throne, people enjoyed a peaceful life under her benevolent reign. But this peaceful existence did not last long... Two adventurers who were wandering through mountains met a mysterious evil being, who threatened to ruin Ariel's kingdom. After that, the two men disappeared without a trace. Ariel's servants reported to her about the matter. After consulting her wise grandmother, Ariel decided to go out herself, to meet up with her old trusty companions and to find out the origin of the new threat.

Characters have HP, MP (SP for fighter characters), EXP, equipment, stats and class-specific, SP-draining special elemental abilities very much like traditional console RPGs. The player can explore his surroundings, talk to people and visit shops when not in battle, though to a limited degree as there is no world map and no way to leave the current area.

The game's core is its turn-based battles fought on a 2d grid. Characters are assembled into parties of four and the player allowed a maximum of six parties, which are usually well outnumbered. The two opposing sides act in alternating turns so that each party can move once and/or attack once a turn. Attacks are divided into distant and close-up combat. In the former, a party uses a special ability (e.g. casting fireballs, throwing lightning, healing allies) of one of its members at a distance. The range and possible area of effect damage vary per ability. If the attacking party has two or more characters with the same ability, they join in the action to multiply its effectiveness. Distant combat results in less money and generally less damage, but the target cannot retaliate. Distant attacks can also affect the field; fire and ice ignite or extinguish forests and melt or freeze ice, etc. Close-up, each unit in two adjacent opposing parties can act once. Very much like Final Fantasy SNES combat, they can attack an enemy, use an item or a special ability (though these can't be combined and most only affect one target instead of all) or defend.

Dragons are the player's ace in the hole. They have their own stats and gain experience like normal characters do. In battle, each party has a dragon attached to it and draws a large portion of its strength from that of its dragon: if a party's dragon is slain, the party will lose the ability to use special attacks and class-specific abilities for the remainder of the map. The beast acts as a very powerful autonomous unit that moves after its party does and it cannot be controlled beyond very simple commands, e.g. ""Come!"" Out of battle, dragons will eat anything and raising them by feeding them items is an important part of the game. Feeding can improve their stats as well as affect their behavior on the field, and the dragons develop into new forms as they grow.

The player can change the characters in each of the parties, their formation as well as what dragon represents them at will."

Various power-ups may appear after destructible blocks are removed, which can give the player an edge or, in the case of the ? icon, a possible random negative effect like reversed controls. There are also wandering monsters that can cause damage to anyone they come in contact with. Every combatant has a health bar which depletes at a rate dependent on the attacks they are getting hit by.

The game makes heavy use of fog of war, making it impossible to see the enemy's team unless they get within visual range. The player characters can use cover and change the direction they're facing, which allows them to get the drop on enemies.

"Boxing Legends of the Ring","","Region Not Set","","Electro-Brain","Sculptured Software","1994-11-01","2","No","Fighting | Sports","Not Rated","Boxing Legends of the Ring is a boxing video game for the Mega Drive/Genesis and Super NES consoles. The boxers are represented by 2D sprites seen from over the shoulder of one of the fighters. The title of the game refers to the famous boxing magazine, The Ring, which the game is licensed to associate itself with. The following famous middleweight boxers are represented in the game: Sugar Ray Leonard, Roberto Durán, Thomas Hearns, James Toney, Marvin Hagler, Jake LaMotta, Sugar Ray Robinson, and Rocky Graziano.

During fights, it is possible to keep track of the participating boxers' wellbeing by observing the small portraits of the fighters' faces at the top of the screen. As the fighters receive punishment, these portraits show injuries such as cuts and bruises, the severity of which indicate the fighter's health (or lack of). There is also a boxing glove shaped meter at the top of the screen, that indicates how much power a boxer has left in his punches (as in a real fight, the more punches boxers throw, the more tired they become, resulting in weaker punches).
 
The fighters movement about the ring is limited to side-stepping left or right; it is impossible to step back or forward. A variety of punches can be thrown; left jabs, crosses to the head, hooks to the body, and uppercuts to the head (all punches except jabs can be thrown with either hand). It is also possible to throw a limited number of so-called 'super punches', that are essentially either a right cross or a right uppercut, but with extra power. At the start of each round, each boxer is capable of throwing one super-punch at any time, although it becomes possible to throw one more with each knockdown they score against their opponent. Defensive techniques consist of blocking, dodging, and clinching. Each boxer has three attributes: 'power', 'stamina', and 'chin'."

The bat is a trampoline held by two Rick-like hamsters. The game uses a star-counter, which decreases periodically on its own. Hitting any one block will dislodge several stars which fall down from where the block was - catching one will increment the player's star counter by 5. If Kirby (the ball) hits the ground when the star counter is higher than zero, he will bounce once, so the player gets one more chance to catch him. Otherwise, the player loses a life. Every time Kirby touches the ground, the star counter is reduced by 10.

Once the player clears the first five stages, King Dedede appears in stage 6. This stage has no blocks, so the player's star counter cannot increase. Dedede throws hammers from time to time - if Rick is hit, the player will not be able to control him for a short while. Hitting Dedede enough times will defeat him.

Stylistically similar to The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past for the SNES, BS Zelda no Densetsu: Inishie no Sekiban is also occasionally regarded as an enhanced remake of this title.

The application on this cartridge took the form of a game; however, its actual purpose was to serve as an interactive menu system for the console subunit. On start-up the player would enter a name, selected either a male or female character avatar, and then move the avatar around a virtual town. Houses and shops in the town served as download locations where the player could directly download games, particular game data, or digital magazines. The download would write game data into temporary memory locations which would remain until the player downloaded a new game to take its place.

Apart from downloads, players could also travel to in-game locations such as the Wall Newspaper Co. (かべ新聞社 kabe shinbunsha?) to read brief text-only postcard-like messages from St.GIGA and Nintendo that announced contest winners, revealed future games and future programming schedule details, and served to raise awareness for celebrity events relating to SoundLink Magazine performers' off-Satellaview activities. Furthermore, the avatar was equipped with an inventory and game currency which could be spent on various in-game items such as telephone cards, vehicle tickets, fish bait, and shoes that would enable the player to dash rather than walk everywhere. While the BS-X application cartridge had none of the challenges typically associated with games, it featured a plot of sorts and thus can be considered a video game in a narratalogical sense."

The same goes for the sequence in which a goalkeeper tries to stop any of the special shots.

The game is also entirely split screen, with a second player or the computer opponent taking the controls on the second half of the secreen. Players control an aircraft pilot of either the United States or Japanese Empire. Based aboard an aircraft carrier, the player can engage in the following missions: 1vs1 dogfights, strafing runs on enemy ships, dive bombing on enemy ships, torpedo runs on enemy ships and carrier landings. All missions are made up of these elements, however campaign missions also feature the ability to decide which aircraft to bring into battle, each with it's own statistics, and keep track of progress on an area map. When two forces engage each other on this map, players can choose which plane to bring into battle and it will close in a 1vs1 battle with the enemy. In dogfights, both players control an aircraft whereas during ship combat, one player controls an aircraft and the other will control the ship's turret gun. Aircraft controls include being able to tilt left and right, climb, dive, increase speed, decrease speed, fire guns, release bombs/torpedoes (if present) and do a 180 degree loop. Turret controls are more limited, only allowing the player to aim left and right, fire the gun and zoom."

Players take control of a floating Casper, who is followed by Kat throughout the Manor. Gameplay consists of Casper picking up items that he will be able to morph into, enabling him to fight off various enemies and to also assist Kat in getting through the mansion unscathed. Examples of some of the items Casper can turn into are a butterfly net, a pillow, and a plunger. Casper also has the ability to turn invincible as a defensive maneuver. Casper can leave the screen that Kat is on, but if he strays too far away from her, she will be abducted by a ghost."

During the course of the game, Kat collects items, therefore making this game an adventure game as opposed to an action game.

Baseballs are used to stun the enemies. Getting hit by an enemy results in a game over. There is even a box to the bottom right that keeps track of time (in seconds and minutes); the game starts with ten seconds elapsed. Saving the game is performed by finding mechanical contraptions and activating them.

"Castlemania","Castlemania (v1.0)","Other","","","","2024-07-19","1","No","Action | Platform","Not Rated","This rom hack is inspired by the early Castlevania series and attempts to channel the spirit of ‘NES difficulty’. It’s designed to be a throwback hack of sorts- with instant-death blocks, secrets, and familiar enemies to fans of the franchise. Each level was designed with a custom graphics set and soundtrack paying homage to the source material. Some sections offer tighter platforming than others without feeling cheap or unfair to the player. Most importantly- each level has a clear path forward with the player never wondering where to go or what to do next. Fans of the Castlevania series know of it’s difficult nature and shouldn’t be surprised by any obstacles within the hack. To channel the concept of ‘NES difficulty’, this hack will not save until you complete all 6 levels, and GAME OVER will result in the player having to start over.

NOTE: In playtesting, a few testers thought it necessary to offer an alternate version of this hack. It was decided the download file will also include an ‘EASY VERSION’ which will allow the player to save their progress after every level is cleared. This also lets the player CONTINUE after Game Over. Other than slight palette changes to differentiate the two- both versions are exactly the same. It also should be noted some of the level bosses don’t indicate damage, however as long as your attacks are making contact it is in fact taking damage. These are attributes of the sprites used unfortunately..

Good luck, have fun and THANK YOU for playing!"

During a small skirmish with Zentradi forces, young pilot Hikaru Ichijyo rescues idol singer Lynn Minmay and their relationship develops as they're stranded somewhere within the ship.

Their fighting is interrupted by the threat of invasion from a much more potent alien race. The 3 planets find that they are able to set aside their differences long enough to battle their shared menace.

Each planet sends a warrior to deal with the threat. There is a robot named Triton, a cat-like quadruped named Panthera, and a giant red bipedal insect alien name Alcedes. The single player of the game controls one of these characters at a time and can switch at any time. If the current character loses all of his health, the player is sent back to the start of the level and that one character receives a health refill.

Each character has special attributes that help the team. For example, Panthera's relatively small size allows him to squeeze into spots where the other 2 characters can not travel. The characters can gather a number of unique powerups and weapons to help them on their mission."

When the Demon Rain falls,
The ground will turn to dirt,
And the sea will lose its shine.
 - Legend, from the Grandol Royal Library -

There once was a peaceful realm,
known as Grandol...

There was a time when demons had taken Grandol,
and the world was on the edge of destruction.
But with the power of the Miracle Gem, peace was restored.

Afterwards, the powerful Miracle Gem was shattered and sealed 
away, since the peace of Grandol had been obtained.

Then, on a certain day, one hundred years later...

Suddenly, an enormous cloud took over the Grandol sky,
and the Demon Rain started to fall.

The wicked power of the Demon Rain 
changed the nature of Grandol.
And when the Demon Rain stopped,
a castle appeared atop the clouds...

At this point, in the aftermath of the Demon Rain,
the Demon Holes started showing up.
Monsters began to appear from these.

The Demon Rain seeped deep underground,
where long ago the fragments of the Miracle Gem 
were sealed with fifteen demons.

They reawakened. In the large Rulvesos Castle,
the voice of a goddess reached King Rulvesos...

""King Rulvesos, demons are taking over
everything, even to Heaven itself.
But there is hope; items called the Crystal
Beans can be used to our advantage.
They can call the Heroes of Light,
to save Grandol!!""

When the goddess' voice faded,
a light shot down from the Heavens to Rulvesos castle,
to a room known as the ""Hero Room"".

Here, weapons appeared around a Crystal Bean,
delivered by the goddess...

And the Heroes of Light appeared,
to aid King Rulvesos.

Now, with the power of the Crystal,
the Heroes of Light have come down
from the Heavens.
They set out...

This game is intended for experienced role-playing gamers only. The random encounters are high even for a Japanese role-playing game with a mid-to-late 1992 Super Famicom release date (i.e., Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride) and the combat sequences (using melee attacks in addition to missiles and guns) are extremely slow. Two years later, a sequel was released for this game titled Cyber Knight II: Chikyū Teikoku no Yabō. The games were only released commercially in Japan, however there are a fan-translations from Japanese to English by Aeon Genesis.

In the 24th century, mankind has gone into space. The crew of the starship Swordfish are in an engagement with space pirates when the battle takes a turn for the worse. In desperation, the crew activate their jump drive without a destination... and end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant ""Module"" mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed ""Berserkers"". The crew of the swordfish must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to return home.

Cyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind ""NeoParts"", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills.

Combat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of ""options"" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Swordfish."

It is a time of civil war amongst the federated planets, and the crew has been thrown directly into the center! Soon, new weapons called Metalliforms are created, which the General intends to use to conquer the galaxy!

This thing´s moved really fast. It took just under two months, but it´s at the point where the game is not only fully playable, but it´s also one of the nicest pieces of work I´ve done yet. Seriously, the hacking on this is really pretty. Variable-width font for the main dialogue, multi-line 8x8, text hacked to allow more space... You name it, this thing´s got all the bells and whistles.

The gameplay is fantastic, too. It´s got everything about the original Cyber Knight that was refreshing and nifty, cleans up the spotty bits that were a little aggravating, and improves on the forumla ten times over. This game is seriously amazing, folks. I haven´t had this much fun playtesting a game since Shin Megami Tensei. Even if you didn´t like the original Cyber Knight, chances are you´ll love this one. The story´s better, there´s an autobattle, there are even more neoparts, the star map interface is greatly improved, your ""inactive"" characters are automatically relegated to Support Modules and are able to not only gain combat experience but also use their skills and sometimes even finish battles before they even begin... The list goes on! It´s done and there shouldn´t be any problems, so play and enjoy!"

Through the Light came the Darkness, and through the Darkness came the Light. They were inseparable in the beginning, and gave birth to each other. Rukyu appeared before all the other creatures, the great demon of darkness, later to be known as the Satan.

The game is quite different from most other RPGs, because it lets you play as both the ""good"" hero and the villain.

"Demon's Blazon","","NTSC-J","Japan","Capcom","Capcom","1994-10-21","1","No","Action | Platform","M - Mature 17+","Demon's Crest, known as Demon's Blazon: Makaimura Monshō hen (デモンズブレイゾン 魔界村 紋章編, which translates to ""Demon's Blazon: Demon World Village - Crest Arc"") in Japan, is a side-scrolling platform game developed and published by Capcom in 1994 for the SNES video game console. The game is part of the Gargoyle's Quest sub-series of the Ghosts 'n Goblins franchise.

It is said that the world was once divided into two realms, one belonging to humans and one inhabited by demons.  One day six magical crests, each containing power over one of the elements, fell into the Demon Realm (Makai in the Japanese version). The realm erupted into civil war as the demons fought over the crests. Thus, the Crest War raged until Firebrand, the Red Demon (Red Arremer  in the Japanese Version), claimed the crests of Earth, Wind, Fire, Water and Time. Not satisfied that possessing that those Crests alone would end the war, he fought Somulo for the prize of the Crest of Heaven, Firebrand emerged victorious. But the cost of victory was high, as he was mortally wounded.

In that moment a cunning demon named Phalanx took advantage of Firebrand’s weakness and ambushed him, stealing the Crests he’d fought so hard to gain and claiming their power as his own.  Phalanx used this power to summon the Crest of Infinity but, little did he know, the Crest of Fire had been damaged in the earlier battle, (a shard of it was still in Firebrand’s possession) causing it to shatter.  Phalanx was unable to attain ultimate power but still managed to bring an end to the Crest War by setting the Demon Realm ablaze (whether this was intentional or by accident was never explained).  Phalanx would go on to blame the catastrophe on Firebrand, rescue all of the victims and use his newfound popularity to crown himself their ruler.

Meanwhile Firebrand was imprisoned within the Coliseum, healing his wounds and biding his time until he could escape.  After many years he saw his opportunity and broke free.  But his path was blocked by his old foe, Somulo, who had used the remnants of the power he drew from the Crest of Heaven to revive himself.  Barely surviving his rematch with the undead dragon, Firebrand emerges into a world now ruled by Phalanx.  This is the beginning of his quest to reclaim the power of the Crests and take vengeance upon Phalanx once and for all.

And so the story begins."

Since the dawn of time, the men and women of El Sallia have grappled with the ever-present threat of darkness... Long ago, in ancient times, there was a battle among several kingdoms in the land. It was a time when chaos and intrigue ruled human hearts. In the flames of war, the Holy King Sieghart forged Langrisser, a sword to vanquish evil, and banished the darkness to the desolate land of Velzeria. The descendants of Lewin, first king of Baldea, were charged with guarding the sword for all time. Hundreds of years later, the greed of a would-be Kaiser wrested the blade from Baldea’s safe-keeping and unleashed darkness upon the land once more. The surviving prince of the fallen kingdom and his comrades defeated the darkness and put to rest an evil god. Centuries of peace reigned in the land, and eventually, Baldea’s role was forgotten. The castle fell into ruin and its heir escaped with his swordsmanship instructor... Years passed, and a new nation has risen to power in El Sallia. The Rayguard Empire founded by Kaiser Bernhardt, a former mercenary bent on uniting the lands no matter the means or the cost. To fulfil his ambition, he has claimed Alhazard, Chaos’s Might, the sword of the demon tribe."

Combining at least three matching symbols in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line does not only clear them off the screen, but also deals damage to an opponent. This means that players do not only have to keep their game area clear, but also pay attention to their characters health bar. Once a block touches the top of the screen or the health bar is diminished the game ends.

There are four different icons that have different effects when combined:
Books, swords and rocks deal damage to an opponent by attacking with fireballs, dragons or swords.
Bottles heal a certain amount of health.
Purple blocks have no effect, but clog up the screen nonetheless.

Chain reactions result in particularly powerful attacks or place one or more grey blocks inside the opponents area. They can be destroyed just like ordinary blocks, but they always stay in the same spot and do not fall down.

More complex chain reactions give access to special attacks, up to three of which can be held and activated with the shoulder buttons. Special attacks have different effects that include clearing all purple blocks, using all potions and clearing the bottom three lines."

"Eightbound","","NTSC","United States of America","","","2018-12-24","1","No","Action | Adventure | Role-Playing","E - Everyone","EightBound is a Final Fantasy experience, roughly a year and a half in the making.

With this patch, Polinym and Mareeta have transformed EarthBound into a brand new Final Fantasy game, celebrating the first nine games of the series. All nine games receive equal representation through content in the game, including less popular titles like II and III.

All menus, text, commands, items, enemies, and magic have been converted into Final Fantasy terms. The battle system was also adjusted to make battle more frantic, fast-paced, and exciting. Instead of mashing the A-Button through several sentences, the messages now get right to the point and fly by before the player’s eyes.

The entire story of the game has been rewritten as a comedic parody of both EarthBound AND Final Fantasy. The story is based around Final Fantasy VIII. Squall and his friends must grow their power to stop Ultimecia, the terror of the time-space continuum. Along the way, they meet many familiar faces from across the Final Fantasy series.

In EightBound, many of the frustrating and poorly balanced segments of EarthBound have been revised, rebalanced, and made more fun. Grinding is no longer required at all, except at the end of the game to deal with the abundant post-game content.

At the same time, EightBound was also made MUCH more difficult compared to EarthBound. Bosses will take serious time and effort to defeat, and there many, MANY more bosses the overcome. Strategic thinking and thorough knowledge of the battle system are required to win the more difficult fights. This difficulty is not just increased stats, but each and every boss was carefully designed to be unique with specific strengths and weakness which the player must learn. So many bosses were added, in fact, that the game also features a new BOSS RUSH mode, with three paths of difficulty. In Boss Rush, players must use their end-game power to overcome a series of boss fights in a row.

Like any good Final Fantasy game, EightBound features its unique “gimmick” to the fighting system. Players can make use of “Spell-Casting Items”, which grant players new moves when used in battle. These Spell-Casting Items, like the Judgement Staff, Sylph Magicite, Nepto Scale, and more, can be arranged on party members as the player chooses.

Players will laugh, players will cry. Players will throw their controller at the screen in frustration. Anyone can get into playing EightBound, but only true masters will be able to make it out alive. EightBound truly has something for everyone."

It was emulated for the Virtual Console service on various Nintendo platforms over the years and as part of the Super NES Classic Edition in 2017.

The game takes place in the year 2560, where multi-billionaires with lethargic lifestyles created a new form of entertainment based on the Formula One races called ""F-Zero"". The player can choose between one of four characters in the game, each with their respective hovercar. The player can race against computer-controlled characters in fifteen tracks divided into three leagues.

F-Zero has been acknowledged by critics as one of the greatest video games of all time as well for setting the standard for the racing genre and the creation of its futuristic subgenre. Critics lauded F-Zero for its fast and challenging gameplay, variety of tracks, and extensive use of the graphical mode called ""Mode 7"". This graphics-rendering technique was an innovative technological achievement at the time that made racing games more realistic, the first of which was F-Zero. As a result, it is credited for reinvigorating the genre and inspiring the future creation of numerous racing games.

He is sent to jail to be executed, but manages to escape with the help of two former unit colleagues. The group flees through the country-side, while being pursued by imperial soldiers. On their way, they join forces with other rebels to fight against the enemy, while uncovering hidden secrets and evil plots by the Empire.

FEDA: Emblem of Justice is a strategy RPG similar to Shining Force and other titles with preset characters and linear gameplay. The player commands a party of varying size and characters with diverse skills.

In the main battle sections, the player and the CPU-controlled enemy take turns moving the troops and giving orders. A menu at the bottom of the screen shows all the possible actions, where soldiers can defend, move, attack, or use an inventory item on each turn. The range of their movements and weapons vary according to their nature. A crossbow character can shoot from the back, while most sword and knife users have to be adjacent to their targets. Magic offensive powers have different ranges as well, reaching enemies that are far away from the attacking character. Health points can be recovered by eating rations or by magic, where a healer can restore points to several characters at once.

Each party member has separate health and magic points, as well as other statistics like defense and attack power. They receive experience points after slaying an enemy or casting a spell, and extra points at the end of the battle. Their skills increase after surpassing 100 points.

The map screen shows the party and groups of enemies traveling through the landscape in turns. The menu has options for moving the group or camping. In the encampment, one of the characters around the fire pit saves the game, while another inside the tent provides system options to change the interface color, adjust sound volume and rename the party members.

In some locations like temples, villages and towns, the party has to explore the place and talk to the citizens to move on to the next section. In later battles, the player has to make a moral choice about attacking mutated humans. At the end of each battle, the party is assigned a dark or light emblem, and certain party members choose to leave or stay in the group based on its alignment."

At it’s heart, it is a storyline modification, re-arranging content, re-purposing content, and sometimes adding new content in order to make the game flow more naturally. Leo has been repurposed from a guest to a main character, with a full character arc, sidequests, and even his own musical theme. In addition, every named character receives an end to their story arc, both main characters and side characters.

There are more edits than just storyline modifications though. Instead of replacing an existing character, Leo is added as a 15th fully-playable character. A secret 16th character has been added too. You can even recruit crew members to the Falcon! There are new spells, new espers, new abilities, a reduced encounter rate, dummied content restored, and more. Over 2 dozen hackers are listed in the credits of the manual for contributions to this project.

Even with all of those changes listed, Divergent Paths has become somewhat noteworthy not for its changes, but for its restraint. There is no difficulty rebalancing, no retranslation, no graphical changes, and only a handful of spells and items renamed. Every change is made in service to its characters, and the core of the game remains the same. It never stops feeling like the Final Fantasy 6 you know and love."

Capcom followed up the game with another SNES-exclusive sequel, Final Fight 3, which saw the return of Guy to the series. None of the new characters from Final Fight 2 returned, although Maki made appearances in various Capcom fighting games years later"

Inspired by pioneering works such as Isocitration’s SMW2 Hack and pinnor’s Trouble in Paradise, we set out to dive headfirst into all of YI’s wonderful and silly possibilities. The result of our collective labor is Flutter! - a 30 stage hack that shifts between traditional and classic YI design, Kaizo style platforming, and puzzles that explore and abuse the game’s unusual mechanics.

The original YI was a game centered around exploration, but we've molded it to fit the type of game we wanted to make. Red coins and the star counter have been abolished, resulting in flowers being the only collectible. Additionally, baby Mario has been left at home, allowing Yoshi to enjoy his own adventure without the constant threat of ear-splitting crying noises. Lastly, the game has a quick instant-retry system upon death, which also saves flowers upon collection, so you only have to collect each flower once.

As a result, Flutter! is a lot more streamlined, focusing on both platforming and the exploration of unusual ideas. Enthusiasts of the original YI will still find plenty of facets of the original that they should enjoy. Adventurers should be warned, however - to collect every flower and 100% the game, you will need a healthy appetite for challenging puzzles and setups that require you to stop and think critically.

Throughout our time working on this hack, we’ve really grown to appreciate the wonderful silly game that is Yoshi’s Island, and exploring all of its potential together has been very rewarding. We hope you enjoy playing this as much as we enjoyed creating it."

The landmass was large enough to classify as an island in 2002 and all authority and proprietary rights was granted to the United Nations.""). Roid's fiancee, Karen Meure, is already inside. However, the uneasy quiet is broken when a USN Wanzer squad led by an officer named Driscoll ambushes Meure on the premises.

After the player defeats the rest of the USN force, Driscoll escapes, but not before he detonates bombs inside the complex.

The entire incident is pinned on Roid and Sakata, who are summarily dismissed from the OCU Ground Defense Force.

The government alliance that had supported the building of ATLAS now find themselves facing economic crisis as the balance of power shifts. In this world of conflict and change, the Walking Panzer, or Wanzer, (a form of mecha) becomes the standard armored unit for wars and petty battles across the globe. For the small nation of Bergen, a coup d'etat is underway, staged by Colonel Ark. Seeking to establish complete control over the government and the NORAD units stationed there, Ark's first step involves the capture of President Orwen. Tipped off to the rebellion, Orwen seeks to flee from Bergen, looking for safe passage out of the seaport of Port Ertothal. A young Wanzer pilot, Albert Grabner, is assigned escort duty to the president by loyal elements of the army stationed there...

Gun Hazard is a side-scrolling version of the Front Mission series. Gameplay is more than a little similar to Cybernator or Metal Warriors. The player moves between different stages on an area map. Once inside a level, the player controls Albert and his wanzer as it moves left, right across the screen. The wanzer is able to jump, and attack with a primary and a special weapon. At any time during a level, Albert can eject from his heavily armed wanzer to explore. Although vulnerable when outside, Albert is able to reach areas the wanzer cannot, in addition to being a smaller target and being able to jetpack indefinitely.

Additionally, Albert can recruit other characters through the normal course of the story, some of whom can be designated to support roles. These support characters when set can provide a variety of different cover fire abilities for Albert during his missions. They too gain experience and levels. Different weapons and armor can be found or bought. Essential components include the Booster ability which allows the wanzer to hover and increase it's jumps, as well as the Dash ability which allows quick left-right movement by the wanzer. Money and experience are earned through the completion of level objectives as well as the kill count of enemy wanzers."

Played from an third-person perspective using a view from right over the shoulders over the boxer, players can move left and right to dodge incoming punches, block and throw left and right punches. The standard punch is a cross, but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown.

By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available, inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet. The screen shows an energy meter drained when punches are received. After being knocked down and during intermissions, some energy is restored.

All versions, except for the Game Boy, can be played with two players. A password system is used to save the progress."

The SNES version is far more like a simulation than most games of this type, with players directing their fleet and combat from a computer console. The goal is effective macro-level management of the large number of ships under the player's command, rather than focusing on any one ship and its encounters."

The gentle Gradians thought they were cured of Bacterion’s contemptible curse after generations of germ-free living. Guess again. That wretched fiend is once again wreaking havoc on Gradius and the surrounding planets. It’s your destiny to put an end to it. Unless maybe you think life as an amoeba would be pleasant!
You play a key role in engineering your M.A.X. starship’s battle gear and arsenal.

Do so and you’ll gallantly conquer the galactic gargoyles and obstacles in ten Terror Zones, such as the Dunes of Doom, Bacterion’s Garden, and The Greased Lightning Round. Just when you think you’ve made it through each of the Zones, you’ll be greeted by a hideous Mayor who will try to see that his Zone is your last. Choose from three difficulty levels to see just how keen your alien zapping skills are. Throughout your journey, you will be engulfed in magnificent stereo sound and stunning visual effects that will dazzle your senses.
In the final forum, you’ll have to be as tough as Orakian ore to confront Bacterion and disintegrate its hailstone of a heart. If you do, all that is good in the universe will breathe a sigh of relief. And if you don’t, you’ll hear the echo of a solitary clap and the final Dark Curtain will fall.

The game permits players to play soccer on an international level with all the national teams that took part in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, except the inclusion of Japan instead of South Korea.

Most of the text is in Japanese; including the players' surnames. Eight different players can become the captain of the player's team and the team can use one of five different formations (4-4-2, 4-3-3, 3-5-2, WM and libero). All of the formations are used in modern day soccer except for the WM formation (which saw common use in England during the 1930s). The star player (captain) chosen kicks a shot (super shot or hyper shot) that pushes the goalkeeper into the stands, just like in Hat Trick Hero. Exhibition, world league (similar to a World Cup tournament) and Taito Cup (24 teams to beat) are the three possible variations in the game. After beating all the 23 national teams in the Taito cup mode, there is a final game against a team with the abbreviation ""NLC"". Mode 7 graphics give the game a sense of perspective.

Hat Trick Hero 2 is the sequel to Football Champ in Japan (where it was known as Hat Trick Hero), and is loosely based on the coin-operated video game Hat Trick Hero '93."

While the game seems short-featured for 1995 standards, the tournament mode includes a twist: depending on how well the player defeats his opponents, he can trade his ""standard players"", who won't do anything spectacular (but at least fill up the ranks) for star players, who not only look different, are able to cross and backheel the ball but also have a unique ability at the disposal of the player:"

The ultimate puzzle game, starring the eight unique Hebereke characters! Play against the computer or take on a friend for non-stop Hebereke fun!

Line up four or more Popoons and Poroporo characters of the same color to make them disappear. Use the special color combo attacks to make Popoons and Poroporos pour into your opponent's area! Be the first to get rid of all your Poroporos to win!

Similar to other falling block tile-matching video games, the core gameplay element consists of player-controlled blocks falling from the top of the playing field. In Hebereke's Popoitto, pairs of blocks, where each block in the pair can be any available color, appear from the top of the playing field and continue to fall until they fall on top of the ground or another block. The pair of blocks are, as long as they're still falling, controlled by the player and can be rotated.When a pair of blocks is suspended, a new pair of player-controlled blocks will fall from playing field ceiling. By lining up four or more blocks with the same color in certain formations the whole formation disappears. The available formations can be straight horizontal or vertical lines or simply just any adjoining formation, depending on the set difficulty level.

What sets Hebereke's Popoitto apart from other similar games is that moving creatures, named Poro-porous, will float suspended in mid-air on the playing field. Sporadically, Poro-porous will move one space right, left, up or down. Touching a Poro-poro with a pair of blocks will as always suspend the blocks, and consequently the erratic behaviour of Poro-porous makes it more difficult for the player to plan ahead. Each Poro-poro has its own color and can be, just as with any other block, destroyed by making a formation with the same color. A game is won when every Poro-poro on the playing field is eliminated. A game can also be lost when the blocks fill up to the top of the playing field.

The difficulty level controls, as stated earlier, the possible formations to build. An easier difficulty level will accept any adjoining formation of same-colored blocks, while a harder difficulty level will only accept straight horizontal or vertical lines. A higher difficulty level will also control the number of different available colors for blocks and the number of Poro-porous that are on the playing field at start."

In one-player mode, the player is forced to choose Hebereke and must play against Oh-Chan.

The game's plot and setting are loosely based around various episodes included in Greek mythology. The hero begins the game in a state of total memory-loss, but discovers that he has somehow acquired a mysterious power that shields him from all bodily harm, essentially making him immortal. The only clue the hero has in discovering his own identity is a mysterious dream that he sees every night, and he begins his journey in search of the location shown in the dream.

The gameplay borrows various motifs from ancient mythology, particularly the concept of immortality. An immortal character can execute certain actions that other characters cannot, like jumping off high cliffs without being injured. The game's writer, Kazushige Nojima, composed a storyline where the hero encounters the Greek gods while trying to discover his own true identity. Like the game's predecessor, Heracles no Eikō II: Titan no Metsubō, the game focuses on its rich storyline rather than the game system, which does not differ significantly from other role-playing video games of the period."

You assume the role of a student (whose gender you can choose) still aboard the flight towards the fictional Utsuho Island of Southern Japan, the location of the strangest school of the country: Hourai High School. This huge educational complex, which houses more than one million students and personnel (how is that even possible?), seems to acts as a magnet for weird youngsters and nonsensical events. And you get the privilege of a great start. Indeed, an irritated stewardess decides to send you to your destination via a shortcut... by throwing you out of the plane with a parachute. After a forced landing through a ceiling, here you are, at Hourai High School. The year hasn't started yet and teachers already have you in their sights. You'll get to meet new friends real soon however, particularly the guys behind the school's newspaper ""Hourai Sports"". You'll even get the chance to take the place of the editor, even though you are the one who sent him to hospital by landing on his head. But the course of your new school year will soon be disrupted by the establishment of extravagantly oppressive school laws, which seem to be manipulated from behind the throne. Some may compare this game to Mother 2, seeing the delirious scenario and modern setting. They wouldn't be entirely wrong, as Hourai Gakuen no Bouken, more than its atypical universe, shares with it classical RPG gameplay and first-person battles. The progression is pretty different, though. It's based on the school campus's map, with each of its parts constituting ""villages"" of some sort, and to which the player will be required to come back regularly to use the services housed in the main buildings. The limits of the world map will widen as the chapters that lead us through the school year unfold, and more exotic and less ""academic"" regions will gradually make their apparition."

Corrections of minor historical errors that were present in the first version;

A new, revamped opening, celebrating nostalgia with a modern touch.

Though up to three characters join Frodo on his quest, one player can control only one character at a time.

It is the series debut on the Sega Genesis and later on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Commodore Amiga.

Game play modes include regular season, playoffs and sudden death. The game features 16 regular teams plus one All-Madden team, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Play actions include selecting a pass recipient as a play unfolds, block tackles, dives and sackings. Different weather conditions come into play when it's wet, snowy or muddy.

Its features include various field conditions, audibles, and password-saved games. The game is played from above and behind the quarterback rather than from the side as most games were. However, as in the previous version, no actual NFL teams are included due to the lack of NFL or NFLPA licenses for authentic teams or player names.

During the first initial release (1990) on a console, which was on the Sega Genesis platform, only a total of 16 teams were available to choose from. Each of these teams were based unofficially on teams from the 1990 NFL season. The following generic teams were chosen, with colors based on the local NFL team: Buffalo, Miami, New England, Cincinnati, Houston, Pittsburgh, Denver, Kansas City, New York City (colors based on Giants), Philadelphia, Washington, Chicago, Minnesota, Atlanta, Los Angeles (colors based on Rams) and San Francisco. An All-Madden team was included as a bonus."

The game is played in a top-down view, featuring many elements from classic shoot 'em up games but giving the player free eight-directional movement.

Player 2 assumes a supporting role as one of Pocky's friends each possessing a unique attack and unlimited lives. If there is no second player, the supporting character will be CPU-controlled.

Pocky can use Player 2's character as a utility in various ways. Using ""magic"", she can force herself into her partner's mind and control their body for a short time, enabling unique abilities depending on who she possesses. Additionally, she can throw her partner at enemies to attack, doing massive damage to the enemy but temporarily killing the thrown character.

Transformed into; Sir Arthur, Sir Breeze, Sir Brick, Sir Darren, Sir Gallop, Sir Lancelot, Sir Lug, Sir Phil, Sir Tone, Sir Trunk, Sir Wally and Sir Zeke,  they must rescue the real Knights of the Round Table. In order to do so, the Arthur must recover the 12 keys of truth from Morgana's lieutenants each of which can only by touched by a specific knight. However in order to be able to defeat them, Arthur must first recover Excalibur and overcome other tasks.

King Arthur & the Knights of Justice is a top-down action game. It might be mistaken for an RPG, however the abilities of characters do not change over the course of the game. Players control Arthur King and can recruit two additional party members from the knights. Each knight has his own statistics in various areas including: Life Force, Defense, Strength and Speed. These party members are computer controlled with their own energy bars. Arthur can move up, down, left and right, block with his shield and parry with his shield. Arthur can swing his sword at any time but the damage inflicted depends on how much strength bar he has. The strength bar replenishes itself naturally over time, but is depleted every time Arthur swings his sword. Each knight including Arthur has a health bar, when this bar runs out, the knight is defeated. It can be restored by returning to Camelot or using items such as healing herbs. Arthur can carry a variety of different items accessible from the menu. Other menu functions include looking at the map, changing preferences and reviewing the statistics of the knights."

It received a remake for the Super Famicom in Japan in 1998.

Kirby's Star Stacker is similar in many respects to other puzzle games that were around at the time of its release, most notably, Dr. Mario and Tetris. The goal of the game is to earn as many stars possible by matching pairs blocks, (also referred to as friends in-game) that fall from the top of the play area. There are three types of blocks, all based on Kirby's friends from Kirby's Dream Land 2: Rick the hamster, Coo the owl, and Kine the fish. Stars are scored by sandwiching the stars between two matching blocks. When stars are scored, they disappear from the play area along with the pair of blocks enclosing them. The game is lost when the falling blocks reach the top of the play area, so it is critical to eliminate as many blocks as possible by scoring stars.

One of the primary enhancements of the SNES remake is story mode, in which Kirby faces several opponents from other Kirby games (mostly from Kirby Super Star). The game's title is exactly the same as the Japanese title of the Game Boy version of Kirby's Star Stacker. There were plans to release the game overseas, but they were halted after Nintendo of America stopped shipping SNES games in 1997, leaving the game Japan-exclusive."

In the game, groups of two colored blobs fall from the top of the screen. The player must rotate and move the groups before they touch the bottom of the screen or the pile, so that matching-colored blobs touch from above, below, the left or the right. Once four or more same-colored blobs touch, they will disappear, and any blobs above them will fall down to fill in space. If a player manages to set off a chain reaction with these blobs, rocks will fall on the other player's screen, filling it up and giving them less room to drop additional blobs. The number of rocks that falls depends on both the number of blobs popped and the number of consecutive chain reactions. These rocks will only disappear if a player manages to pop a group of blobs that are in direct contact with the rocks. A player will lose if either of the middle columns in the top row is filled with a blob or rock."

In Kishin Douji ZENKI: Battle Raiden the player takes the role of Zenki. At first, and occasionally through the game, Zenki will be in his powered down form where he can only punch, jump, and dash.

By picking up scrolls Zenki can do a powerful Rudora attack to all enemies on screen, but this attack damages Zenki as well.

The game is a spiritual sequel to Vegas Dream (NES).

The player takes on the role of a protagonist which they name. They travel to Vegas by car with their friends Cliff, Richard, Isabelle, and Maria. They only serve as a cosmetic purpose, and are not different from each other. However, they will give the player advice while playing a casino game, and will sometimes join you in a game of poker.

The game features 3 play modes; Vegas Adventure, the main story mode of the game, multi-player, and a continue option. A fourth option, Party Mode, is present only in the Japanese original.

There are five casinos in the game. Some of which are based on real casinos, and others are not. Instead of the HAI Palace in Vegas Dream, there is The Hideaway, the Golden Paradise (based off the Golden Nugget, and is where the game starts), the Buffalo Head, The 2020, and the Laurel Palace (based off Caesars Palace). The latter must be unlocked by winning a certain amount of money. The casinos have betting minimums and maximums for each game. The Hideaway has the cheapest betting ranges, while the Laurel Palace has the most expensive. The Golden Paradise is the medium. The game offers a save option via battery backup, so the player can continue from where they left off.

Each casino has five games; Blackjack, Slot Machines, Roulette, Craps, and Poker. Like its predecessor, you will occasionally run into people that ask for money, which can either have a positive or negative effect on the player based on their decision. Each casino has some interesting characters to run into. For example, in The Hideaway, there's a shabby-looking man who will ask for money, whereas in The 2020, there's a man who looks like he's half human half machine. Each casino has its own theme in terms of graphics and music; The Hideaway has a slow-jazzy theme to add to the overall run-down feel of the casino, the Golden Paradise has an upbeat jazzy theme which fits with the nice-looking casino, and the Laurel Palace contains an elegant organ piece, which bodes well with the ancient Roman look and feel of the casino.

The game was later released for the Wii Virtual Console."

Some of Ciel's classmates live in the Polisian States, which make use of Phelesteau, a perpetual engine that provides free energy for everyone in the city, under one condition: that they never release their gaia within the city limits (or be thrown in prison).

"Libble Rabble","","Region Not Set","","Namco","","1994-09-22","2","No","Action","","Libble Rabble (リブルラブル Riburu Raburu) is an arcade game that was released by Namco in October 1983. It was designed by Toru Iwatani, who had also designed the Gee Bee series, Pac-Man, and Pole Position. It is a curious but challenging game, where the player tries to harvest little mushrooms (Mushlins) while avoiding various enemies, and was the first game from Namco to use a Motorola 68000 processor (which ran at 6.144 MHz).

At first glance, the gameplay resembles Taito's Qix. The player controls two ""arrows"", one red (Libble) and one blue (Rabble) with a line strung between them. The object is to wrap the line around poles and surround Mushlins and enemies with it. The player can either close the loops themselves (worth more points for the Mushlins) or move both arrows to the same edge of the screen. The player clears a ""season"" when he or she harvests all the Mushlins.

Along the way, various enemies will appear and try to stop the player. The most common are four little hooded critters (Hobblins), which start each season in the corners. If the player catches them in a loop, they will be sent to the top of the screen for a short period of time. Other critters such as fireballs (Killers), sparks (Changers), and Demons will also appear. These can be killed by closing a loop around them. Sometimes, scissors-like enemies (Shears) appear, and if they cross the player's line, they cut it. If the player's line is ever cut by Shears or Demons, a new one is instantly made: directly between the two arrows.

Every so often when the player closes a line, a detector goes off indicating that the area he or she has closed off has a treasure chest somewhere. To actually uncover the chest, the player must surround a small enough area which covers just the chest, and no other possible hiding places. The game guides the player along that step, first by challenging him or her to uncover a chest at the start of the game (and then by revealing the locations of the chests for the first two seasons). When the player actually uncovers a chest, six bonus creatures (Topcups) will pop out, then make for the edges. The player must corral them with his or her line and then close the loop to score the bonus for them: they mean bonus letters. If the player manages to complete a bonus word, the season is automatically cleared out and the player moves to a bonus stage where he or she must try to uncover and collect chests (to collect a chest, the player needs to close a loop around an opened chest) within a time limit.

The player loses a life if any of the assorted critters touch one of the arrows or if he or she runs out of time (the border is the player's timer, and he or she can boost the time by looping Mushlins and plants), and the player gains an extra life at 40,000, 120,000, 200,000, 400,000, 600,000 and 1,000,000 points by default. After the 100th season, the season counter will stop at 99, similar to how Galaxian and King & Balloon's round indicators would stop after 48 rounds."

It is based on the Looney Tunes characters Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner.

Road Runner's Death Valley Rally features side-scrolling platform gameplay. The player controls Road Runner, who must avoid being eaten by Wile E. Coyote. The game consists of five different environments, with each one containing three levels and a boss battle.  Coyote has a unique method of ambush for every level, ranging from the Acme BatMan outfit to explosives, and for every level there is a cutscene of the contraption failing once the player crosses the finish mark.  After every three levels, Road Runner battles against one of Wile E. Coyote's super weapons.

Road Runner has a series of control movements useful to beating the game, including jumping and running. Road Runner can also peck his beak to kill enemies, and can eat bird seeds that give him a burst of turbo speed, allowing him to scale walls. However, turbo speed can only be used a limited amount of times, as it depletes the bird seeds; additional turbo speed is gained by consuming more bird seeds. The boost also acts as an invincibility, being able to destroy enemies and resist damage from Coyote.  The player can also make Road Runner say ""beep-beep!"" and make him stick out his tongue, although neither serves a gameplay function."

Among the innovations in Madden 96, the Create-a-Player feature was added, which included many position specific mini-games that would determine the ability of the player.

Jacksonville Jaguars and Carolina Panthers, having debuted in 1995, did not have a secret classic team revealed in this manner, nor did the All-Madden team.

There are 24 characters, all but the Black Pierrot being named after a tarot card (although the Strength card has been represented by two characters throughout the series). Different characters have different attack patterns. The columns of the opponent's stack will descend at different rates relative to each other depending on the character chosen.

(Cosmic Calendar) the leaders of various planets united in order to form a congress that became known as the Galactic Federation in an attempt to construct a fair and structured universe that would enable society to grow and prosper. Under the guidance of this new federation, the individuals of the planets began to associate with each other, and a new civilization began to develop. Various leaps in technology for transportation were created, such as interstellar spaceships, and society flourished through the use of such expansion.

Note: According to Metroid and Metroid II: Return of Samus's manuals, the year of the Galactic Federation formation was the year 2000.[7][8] In Metroid: Zero Mission's manual, the year of the Galactic Federation formation was 2003.[9]

At this time, Earth came into contact with individuals from these other worlds and the advanced technology that these people possessed was shared with the humans of Earth. All seemed well in this new society. However, devious groups known as ""Space Pirates"" began to attack the spaceships in the hopes of looting valuable goods from them and striking fear in the hearts of the people. In order to counter these attacks, the Federal Bureau set up a new combat force known as the Federal Police. Yet the pirates were extremely difficult to battle in the depths of space, even with the advanced technology of the Federation. Thus, they recruited a group of courageous individuals who became known as ""Space Hunters"", equipped with the best weapons available. The Federation provided huge financial bonuses to the Hunters in reward for hunting down and destroying the pirates.

t is now the year 20X5 C.C., and the universe has continued to develop while battles still rage throughout space. Recently, reports have indicated that a spaceship is traveling with a capsule containing an unknown life-force from the deserted planet SR388. This ship has been attacked and seized by the Space Pirates. While research about this life-form, currently in hibernation, is incomplete, it is known that exposure to beta rays for 24 hours will cause it to multiply. Some scientists believe that this life-form may have been the cause of destruction of life on SR388. The Chozo called this being a ""Metroid"" and the mere thought of it being in the hands of pirates is utterly disturbing to the human scientists. If the Pirates learned how to multiply this organism and use it as a biological weapon, the cost of lives could be overwhelming. The Federation launched search teams to find the Pirates and were fortunate to discover that their base was located deep within the planet Zebes. However, none of the forces are strong enough to take the pirates down.

During this outside battle, operations to multiply the Metroid within the Space Pirates' headquarters were soon becoming a reality. Desperate for a solution, the Federation decided that the only option left was to attempt to infiltrate Zebes and destroy the leader of the Space Pirates, ""Mother Brain."" To make matters difficult, the structure of the planet Zebes is a natural fortress that consists of a large maze. Scattered throughout the maze are various traps and allies of the Space Pirates. This mission clearly requires a special individual to complete, and so the federation has selected the most dominating Space Hunter of the entire organization: Samus Aran.

Samus, though human, has a cybernetic suit built by the Chozo, thus providing her with a strange power. She has, to this date, completed many missions considered impossible, and her suit has the power to withstand lethal attacks, while providing many itself. Samus makes her way through the fortress-planet Zebes, collecting weapon and health upgrades, advancing to new areas, defeating Kraid, Ridley, and Mother Brain, and, in the end, destroys all Metroids on Zebes."

"Monstania","","Region Not Set","","Pack-In-Video Co., Ltd","Amccus","1996-01-01","1","No","Role-Playing","Not Rated","Monstania is a Japanese strategy RPG for the Super Famicom. It uses an isometric perspective for its world and combat both, and is known for its brief length compared to other games in its genre.

The hero of the game is Fron, a sixteen-year old boy who lives on the island of Monstania. One day, strolling in the forest, he notices a strange light. The light lead him to a clearing, and then suddenly disappeared. But Fron realized what was the meaning of that light - it was a fairy! Of course, everybody knew that fairies had been long extinct, but Fron never believed in that. All his life he wanted to meet a real fairy, and now, when the opportunity has come, he firmly decides to find her. His girlfriend Tia helps him on the dangerous journey, during which they meet a mysterious little girl named Chitta, and get involved in a grand adventure, that will ultimately lead them to the battle against the dark force that threatens the whole Monstania!

""Monstania"" has a somewhat unusual gameplay within the frames of console RPGs. You don't explore the world in the game: it is entirely linear and takes you to the next destination by itself (only at a few points you can choose where to go next by selecting an appropriate answer). Once within the location, you cannot leave it until you complete all your objectives there, which then take you to the next location. The objective is usually a large strategic battle. You navigate your party members on the battle field, attack with melee and long-ranged weapons, and use special technique which require action points. Unlike most other turn-based strategy games, an enemy makes a move immediately after you did the same with one of your characters, without waiting for the ""enemy turn"". The RPG element is not very significant: your characters level up automatically after each battle. There are also some puzzles to solve in certain locations."

She would be resurrected in the Earthrealm. This would allow Shao Kahn to cross the boundary lines and reclaim his queen.
When Sindel is reincarnated in Earthrealm, Shao Kahn reaches across the dimensions to reclaim her. As a consequence of his action, the Earthrealm becomes a part of the Outworld, instantly stripping billions of their souls. Only a few are spared, as Raiden protects their souls. He tells them that Shao Kahn must be stopped, but he cannot interfere; due to his status, he has no power in Outworld, and Earthrealm is partially merged with Outworld.
Shao Kahn has unleashed extermination squads to roam throughout the Earthrealm and kill any survivors. Also, Raiden's protection only extends to the soul, not to the body, so his chosen warriors have to fight the extermination squads and repel Shao Kahn. Eventually with his final defeat, every human on Earthrealm comes back.

Interactive Entertainment).

It is the second entry in the Mortal Kombat series and is the sequel to Mortal Kombat, improving the gameplay and expanding the mythos of the original Mortal Kombat, notably introducing more varied finishing moves (including several Fatalities per character and new finishers, such as Babality and Friendship) and several iconic characters, such as Kitana, Mileena, Kung Lao, Noob Saibot, and the series' recurring villain, Shao Kahn. The game's plot continues from the first game, featuring the next Mortal Kombat tournament set in the otherdimensional realm of Outworld, with the Outworld and Earthrealm representatives fighting each other on their way to challenge the evil emperor Shao Kahn.

The game was an unprecedented commercial success and was acclaimed by most critics, receiving many annual awards and having been featured in various top lists in the years and decades to come, and also caused a major video game controversy due to the series' continuous depiction of graphic violence. Its legacy includes spawning a spin-off game Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks and having the greatest influence on the 2011 soft reboot game Mortal Kombat, as well as inspiring numerous video game clones. Non-canonical additions to the series, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe and Injustice: Gods Among Us also took place during Mortal Kombat II.

Following his failure to defeat Liu Kang in the previous Mortal Kombat tournament, the evil Shang Tsung begs his master Shao Kahn, supreme ruler of Outworld and the surrounding kingdoms, to spare his life. He tells Shao Kahn that if they hold the next Mortal Kombat Tournament in Outworld, the Earthrealm warriors must travel away from home to attend. Kahn agrees to this plan, and restores Shang Tsung's youth and martial arts prowess. He then extends the invitation to the thunder god and Earthrealm's protector, Raiden, who gathers his warriors and takes them into Outworld. The new tournament is much more dangerous, as Shao Kahn has the home field advantage.

According to the Mortal Kombat series' canon, Liu Kang won this tournament as well, defeating Shao Kahn and his bodyguard Kintaro. The game's story mode can be also finished using any other playable character, resulting in different non-canonical endings for each of them."

The second entry in the Mother series, it was first released in Japan in August 1994, and in North America in June 1995. As Ness and his party of Paula, Jeff and Poo, the player travels the world to collect melodies from eight Sanctuaries in order to defeat the universal cosmic destroyer Giygas.

EarthBound had a lengthy development period that spanned five years. Its returning staff from Mother (1989) included writer/director Shigesato Itoi and lead programmer Satoru Iwata, as well as composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka, who incorporated a diverse range of styles into the soundtrack, including salsa, reggae, and dub. Most of the other staff members had not worked on the original Mother, and the game came under repeated threats of cancellation until Iwata joined the team. Originally scheduled for release in January 1993, the game was completed around May 1994.

Themed around an idiosyncratic portrayal of Americana and Western culture, EarthBound subverted popular role-playing game traditions by featuring a modern setting while parodying numerous staples of the genre. Itoi wanted the game to reach non-gamers with its intentionally goofy tone; for example, the player uses items such as the Pencil Eraser to remove pencil statues, experiences in-game hallucinations, and battles piles of vomit, taxi cabs, and walking nooses. For its American release, the game was marketed with a $2 million promotional campaign that sardonically proclaimed ""this game stinks"". The game's puns and humor were reworked by localizer Marcus Lindblom. Since the original Mother had not been released outside Japan, Mother 2 was called EarthBound to avoid confusion about what it was a sequel to.

Although it was positively received by Japanese audiences, EarthBound sold poorly in the U.S. Journalists attributed this to a combination of its simple graphics, satirical marketing campaign, and a lack of market interest in the genre. In the ensuing years, a dedicated fan community spawned that advocated for the series' recognition, particularly after Ness appeared as a playable character in the Super Smash Bros. series. By the 2000s, multiple reader polls and critics had named it one of the greatest video games ever made, and it became regarded as a ""sacred cow among gaming's cognoscenti"".[3] It was followed by the Japan-only sequel Mother 3 for the Game Boy Advance in 2006. EarthBound was later made available worldwide on the Wii U Virtual Console in 2013, 3DS Virtual Console in 2016, the SNES Classic in 2018, and Nintendo Switch Online in February 2022."

This sequel continued on the ""eat the dots/avoid the ghosts"" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.

Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of ""Junior""."

The graphics are largely the same between the boxers (the head sprite is different in the boxer selection screen, but nothing is different during actual gameplay). The game seemed to feature an interesting rotating boxing ring. There are no sounds in the game, aside from an announcer at the title screen.

The game was being localized for a North American release under the title 7th Saga II, but the release was cancelled.

Seven heroes from seven different Worlds. Seven heroes who were brought to a mysterious temple on a remote island and transformed into statues. Seven heroes who are chosen to bring harmony back to the universe: Miriene the witch (wizard), Lux the tetsujin (a race of iron people), Reeshina the grappler (monk), Tokio the ninja, Kamio the ogre, and Mesia the priestess. The seventh hero is you, the protagonist of the game - the knight Remeer or the female warrior Ferris. Your first task will be to release your companions from the statues they are locked in. You must travel to the Cat World and to retrieve an important artifact. But your main objective is to visit all the seven Worlds and to find seven mystic arks - the items that will re-unite those Worlds and bring peace to them.

""Mystic Ark"" is a RPG closely connected to  7th Saga. You travel on overworld map, visit towns, buy equipment, and descend into dungeons. The combat is turn-based and viewed from a third-person ""over-the-shoulder"" perspective. The battles are not random: the enemies can be seen as white dots on your radar, and if you don't want to fight, you can sometimes outrun or avoid them. The game also contains elements of pure adventure: often you must investigate objects closely and use items from your inventory on them."

The story of Nobunaga takes place during the Japanese civil war of the 16th century. In a wartime strategy game, 15 different warlords are represented across several territories. One to eight human players can play, controlling different leaders and factions. Gameplay is done in one of two scenarios; the beginning of the civil war in 1555 or Nobunaga surrounded by his enemies in 1571. Management of population, supplies and military are the gameplay and successful manipulation of these numbers in the right combination to attack and defend against hostile intentions is what will bring your forces to victory."
"Nobunaga's Ambition","","NTSC","United States of America","Koei Co., Ltd.","Koei","1993-01-01","4","No","Strategy","E - Everyone","In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku (""Warring States"") period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. 

Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.

During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying  Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe & assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain."

Yet, away from this all, outside the edge of time itself, a lone hacker boots up Lunar Magic for the first time. “I think I will add a pitching chuck. Yes, that would be funny”.

A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre. Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times. Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps. The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed three more attempts. Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed directly at the ""gold"" points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for each."
"On the Ball","","Region Not Set","","Taito Corporation","Taito Corporation","1993-01-01","2","No","Puzzle","","There's a kind of knick-knack you may find in dusty games rooms, a maze through which you navigate a marble by subtly tilting the board, dancing with gravity and momentum, deftly rolling your sphere out of dead ends and around the obstacles posed by holes in the board. Marble Madness explores this theme in a fudged 3-D perspective, Cloud Kingdoms in a flat 2-D one -- both by directly influencing the actions of the ball.  The game takes a different approach toward a similar end; instead of moving the ball around the board, you move the board around the ball.

That's right; from the get-go, gravity pulls ever down, down, down on your ball toward the bottom of your screen regardless of board orientation; the task of the player is to rotate the board now clockwise, now counter-clockwise, to further a timely and unobstructed path beneath the ball in its progress toward each level's goal before the timer ticks down to zero.  The game might as well have been named ""inertia.""  Many obstacles can be avoided, but some must be engaged head-on: a certain momentum, if not terminal velocity, must be achieved to break through crumbling brick barriers; other obstacles toggle on and off like traffic lights, demanding not only speed but timing.  Some influence the ball's direction, and in addition to merely delaying the ball's progress, touching some impediments incurs an additional time penalty -- conversely, some blocks bestow time bonuses, if you can afford the ever-diminishing time needed to take the scenic detour and collect them.

It may seem like a transparent attempt to cobble together a game around a technical demo of the SNES' Mode 7 on-the-fly graphics-rotation capabilities, but Taito actually cooked up this kooky game interface two years earlier for an arcade release of this game.

The authorities have asked the hero from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for the ride.

There are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.

You also have a life bar to worry about. If you're shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, and once you're energy is depleted,  you lose one of your three lives. You can lose a lot of energy by killing hostages on purpose,  and you can't easily avoid killing them if you decide to use rocket bombs to wipe out enemies.

The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a ""wall"" on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.

Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It's similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.

From Myth to Laughter (Parodiusu Da! Shinwa kara Owarai e, lit. ""It's Parodius!

The European SNES version is also known as Parodius: Non-Sense Fantasy. The gameplay is stylistically very similar to the Gradius series, but the graphics and music are intentionally absurd.

This game is often mistaken as the original game of the series. The lesser known original game, Parodius: The Octopus Saves the Earth, was released for the MSX computer in Japan.

This is mostly the parody of Gradius (Nemesis on some systems), with some flavor from other shoot-em-ups, like Twinbee. The series is available on numerous platforms.

The game is a right-to-left scrolling shoot-em-up. You can choose from 4 different flying creatures, with different weapons. You must finish 7 stages, each having a boss at the end. You may start at either one, but must complete every level to advance to the final stage."

"PGA European Tour","","Region Not Set","","Black Pearl Software","EA Sports","1996-01-01","4","No","Sports","","European Tour is best thought of as a remake of the original game, rather than a sequel as such. It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 top European pros, rather than the US-leaned lineup of the original. The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering the intervening years of advances in programming skill.

The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect.

As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well."
"PGA Tour 96","","Region Not Set","","Black Pearl Software","Halestorm","1995-01-01","4","No","Sports","","PGA Tour 96 was the last of the series released for Sega's 16-bit console, and technologically the most advanced one. Instead of offering  several generic courses, the three available (Spyglass Hill, Sawgrass and River Highlands) are in 3D, with height differences visible (as well as the limited 3D abilities of the console allow).

The player can either chose to play as one of the 10 PGA Pros (whose swings were digitized), or go Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest drive, driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game (Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match and Shootout), as well as a replay.

Gameplaywise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved triple click system - one to start the swing, other to set strength and a final one for accuracy. It's possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a bush).The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken. However, only in Pro it is possible to make the longest drives, as the amateur and novice levels take a few yards from the total capacity of the club."

Four courses are included, one of them a fantasy 'links' course designed by the programmers. Some of the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water hazards and trees, and the need to plan strategies to get the best approach to the green.

When playing a tournament there are 60 opponents, each representing top US golfers - ten of these appear with tactical advice for each hole."

"Push-Over","","Region Not Set","","Ocean Software Ltd.","Red Rat Software","1992-12-31","1","No","Puzzle","","You're playing a small ant that is willing to help a friend in rather inconvenient situation. Apparently, your friend, doggie, likes to eat cookies that has his picture on their box, and he got himself so carried away that he lost the balance, and a bag of cookies fell deep down into an ant-hill. Now, you're goin' in, in a mission of solving puzzles, and retrieving the cookies for your friend.

Now, this ant-hill is a bit different from the ones you saw, and especially from the one you live in. It's path is filled up with boulders, and all the gates, and you must travel the quest to find the cookies. After each different place inside, you'll fins a small bag of cookie, and bring it back to your friend doggie.

The main quest consists of you carrying your-size boulders, and placing them in a well imagined line, so when you push the exact one, all must fall, and the one that marks the end must fall the last, or the door will stay shut permanently. Beside we know that ants are very easy, and can live almost every fall, you cannot practice that, so if you jusp from a little bit too high position, don't expect much, but to retry the level.

Every block, or boulder in a game has a different markings. Like for example, the yellow ones are bricks you can push, and they will just as easily fall, and push, or not, the brick in front of it. The red ones will do the opposite, you cannot push them, and if the yellow, or any other brick hits it, it'll continue falling back to the other side. Some bricks explode when you push them, or other brick hits them, and that way they leave the hole, so your brick can continue spining, or yet again, not. Some spin without stop, 'til they hit some other brick that can fall, some replaces the spaces, like building a bridge on that place, some go high and when hit the top, they stick to it, and push, or not, the brick in front of them. Anyway, that's the game basics.

Each level gives you the new code/password, so you can continue from the position where you ended each time you type that code. Perspective of your ant is like in any other platform game, and you control it with arrow keys, or joystick. But beware, the time is clicking, so you'll have to solve each level in a hurry."

Thanks to the efforts of Mega Man and his friends, Dr. Wily was finally brought to justice. However, Wily had always known that he might be imprisoned one day, and so he had constructed four advanced models of Robot Masters as backups in a hidden laboratory: Burst Man, Cloud Man, Junk Man, and Freeze Man. If they did not receive any communication for six months, they would activate and begin searching for their master. 6 months later, the robots activate, round up an army, and go on a rampage throughout the city in which Dr. Wily is being held. Mega Man is called into action. Upon driving into the city with Roll and Auto, he sees that it is in ruins, and that he is too late to stop Wily's Robot Masters from liberating the evil scientist. Mega Man gives chase, but is stopped by Bass, a robot with capabilities much like Mega Man's own, and his robotic wolf Treble. After a brief skirmish, Mega Man is informed that the two of them are battling Wily as well.[4] Bass and Treble then take off, leaving Mega Man confused, but convinced that he has new allies and determined to again stop Dr. Wily's plans.

After Wily's Robot Masters are defeated, he dispatches four more to combat the protagonist: Spring Man, Slash Man, Shade Man, and Turbo Man. In one of the locations, Mega Man encounters an injured Bass and sends him to Dr. Light's lab for repairs. Mega Man defeats the remaining Robot Masters and goes back home, learning upon arriving that Bass had gone berserk and had torn up the lab, escaping with parts for new enhancements Dr. Light was working on. Wily appears on the video monitor and reveals that Bass and Treble are actually his own creations, and that they only gained his trust in order to steal the parts.[5] Bass' apparent ambition is to best Mega Man in combat and prove himself as the strongest robot in existence.[6] Mega Man makes his way to Wily's fortress and defeats Bass and Treble, and then Dr. Wily himself. As usual, Wily begs for mercy, but after giving him six chances to change his ways, Mega Man chooses to finish off the mad doctor for good, and threatens him with his Mega Buster. Terrified, Wily explains that as a robot, Mega Man is prevented from harming humans; Mega Man counters that he is ""more than a robot"" (In the Japanese version, Mega Man stops and stands in silence). Before Mega Man could do anything,[7] he is interrupted when the fortress begins to self-destruct, and Bass and Treble arrive to rescue their creator at the last moment. Before escaping, Bass taunts Mega Man for his hesitation (""He who hesitates is lost""), vowing that he, Wily, and Treble will return to get their revenge. Mega Man then escapes the collapsing castle, contemplating the events that transpired, and returns home to his family."

X was a new type of robot with the ability to think, feel, and make his own decisions. Recognizing the potential danger of this model (in particular if he were to break the first rule of robotics: a robot must never harm a human being), Light sealed X away in a diagnostic capsule for over 30 years of testing. X's capsule was uncovered by an archaeologist named Dr. Cain almost 100 years after X's creation. Excited by the possibilities X presented, Cain disregarded the warnings Light had logged in the capsule and created a legion of robots that replicated X's free will; these robots were called ""Reploids"" (shortened from Replica Android, but known as ""Repliroids"" in Japan).

A number of Reploids turned against humans. These Reploids were dubbed ""Mavericks"" (""Irregulars"" in Japan), and a force called the Maverick Hunters (""Irregular Hunters"") was formed to combat them. The Maverick Hunters were led by Sigma until he, too, became a Maverick and declared war against the humans, thus starting the Maverick War. X took it upon himself to join the Maverick Hunters under their new leader Zero. Throughout the series, X, Zero, and later Axl (a prototype of the next-generation Reploid) battle against the Mavericks to stop their plots to destroy the human race.

After the series reached an unresolved cliffhanger, a game entitled ""Mega Man X Dive"" was released by Capcom Taiwan in which a human plays Mega Man X, until due in part to some corrupted data known as Maverick Data, he/she gets transported into the Deep Log, a massive database with data on every Mega Man game.

Dr. Cain, the inventor of the Reploids, establishes a military taskforce called the ""Maverick Hunters"" to prevent it. Even after two successful efforts by the Hunters Mega Man X and Zero to stop a Maverick leader named Sigma from attempting to exterminate the human race, Maverick activity seems to continue. However, the threat of the Mavericks is later neutralized thanks to the technology of the Reploid scientist Dr. Doppler, which prevents the Mavericks from going berserk. The reformed Reploids form a utopia near their new mentor called ""Dopple Town"". It seemed that all is well until the former Reploids suddenly revert and once again begin causing trouble, even going so far as to attack Hunter headquarters. Doppler is held accountable, and X and Zero are sent out to contain the new threat.

Once the two heroes defeat Doppler and the forces that have sworn allegiance to him, the scientist comes to his senses and realizes all the damage that he has done. He explains that Sigma is alive as a computer virus, and that Doppler was corrupted in order to create a new body for Sigma. X seeks out Sigma, and after an intense battle, the Sigma Virus in its pure form chases X in an attempt to infect and possess him. Once X finds himself at a dead end, one of two things may happen. In one of the game's endings, Zero takes Doppler's true antivirus software and uploads it onto his sabre offscreen. He rushes in to save X just in time and causes Sigma to explode, destroying the lab as they evacuate. However, if Zero is injured during the game, Doppler instead uses his own body as the antivirus and sacrifices himself for the greater good."

"RPM Racing","Radical Psycho Machine Racing","Region Not Set","","Interplay Entertainment Corp.","Blizzard Entertainment","1991-01-01","2","No","Racing","","RPM Racing was preceded by Rareware's R.C. Pro-Am in 1988 and Electronic Art's Racing Destruction Set in 1985, with the latter being the larger influence. It is a precursor to Rock 'n Roll Racing, which was done by the same developer. Combat, obstacles and traction on the non-flat tracks play a significant role. There are 3 vehicle types to choose from that perform differently on pavement, dirt, ice, flat or bumpy tracks. Cars can be armed with oil, nitro and mines. Additionally, there are 3 levels of tires, engines, shocks and armor. There are full race season, single race and custom track modes. In 1 player games, the 2nd player is replaced with one of 8 AI opponents who are each associated with their own vehicle. In season mode, each track has an entrance fee and cash prize for placing 1st; often lesser cash prizes for lesser placements are also awarded. For an additional fee, racers can opt to move to a higher racing class (levels) where fees and prizes are bigger. Each class has its own set of tracks that the player may choose from. No track is mandatory or unavailable within a class. The player also has the option of going back to a lower class for free, which may become necessary if funds are eaten up be fees without winning prizes. However, going up always incurs a fee, even if the player has been there before. Custom track designing is not intuitive but fairly easy to learn. Players can set the track's laps, gravity and starting line type. Each track section can be pavement, dirt, or ice. Track sections are laid out like puzzle pieces on a 2D non-isometric grid (Pipe-Mania style). Sections include horizontal and vertical straights, four standard 90° turns, eight T-sections for diverging and converging multiple paths in any direction and a criss-cross. Either a horizontal or vertical special straight section is used as the starting grid. The starting grid can be oriented forward, reversed, face-off with player 1 forward, or face-off with player 1 reversed. 7 points are used to adjust the 6 slopes in straight sections to 5 different heights. Slopes can be flat (0:1), inclined (1:1), or steep (2:1). Non-straight sections can only be adjusted for height for the entire section at once. An isometric view of individual sections is provided to help to orient the section's design to the adjacent sections. If the edge of a section does not match the height of the adjacent section(s), the player is warned immediately but may proceed without correcting the error immediately. But such error must be eliminated before the track can be saved. Also required for a track to be saved is no dead ends, and a starting grid section. The track verification is surprisingly liberal, even allowing diverging and converging paths that are against the flow of traffic (like turning around and going the wrong way up a freeway merging lane). The AI opponents are generally not able to discern the fastest or shortest route and can even be diverted into a path with no natural exit, or with very clever path designs, valid lap paths can be entirely different for player 1, player 2 and AI players; which can lead to interesting traffic patterns."

The Earth is ruled by heavenly powers, who destroy it and create it again every 4000 years, to end the live of powerful races and to let new ones appear. Many years ago, four great races dominated the Earth: the wise Danans, the beautiful Mermaids, the proud Reptiles, and the strong Giants. But those races had to give place to a newly born race: the humans. During the era of the humans, the planet's air has become filled with smog and the water dirty with pollutants. The cult of the Rudra have appeared and begun fortelling the end of the world. As the 4000 year deadline approaches, three characters each embark on their separate yet intertwined quests.

Sion is a young warrior who wants to take part in a ritual tournament and become the strongest of the kingdom. However a capture of one of the Cultists of Rudras soon complicates his training.
Surlet is a wise magician who is interested in archeology and history of the Earth. He is also a pupil of the famous professor Muench who recently made a very important discovery regarding ancient ruins
Riza is a young druid who lives with her grandfather in a quiet village. She was born with a mysterious jade on her forehead, and now feels the urge to save the world from an inevitable, yet unknown disaster.

Rundra no Hih? is a turn-based RPG, similar in gameplay and graphics to the better known Final Fantasy VI. Whenever players load the game cartridge, they are able to  choose which of the three characters they wish to play. This allows any one of these quests to be saved and put aside for any amount of time, allowing the player to change between characters as they so desire. Regardless of which character is chosen, the game is displayed as a top-view on the overworld and in towns. Players can move around to different locations, search treasure chests and talk to townspeople. On the overworld and in dungeons, random encounters can occur. During battles the game is displayed from a side-view and is turn-based between the player's characters and monsters. Players are able to Fight with their weapon, use mantras (magic), use items, defend or run away. Defeat of monsters will result in the party earning experience points and money, which can be spent to buy new weapons, armor and items.

The game's mantra (magic) system is unique in that all spells are formed up of syllables, each with it's own effect (for instance, the syllable ""Ig"" represents fire and the syllable ""ga"" augments any mantra's power over it's basic form. Therefore ""Igga"" is a more powerful version than ""Ig"" alone). Syllables must be arranged in proper combinations in order to form effective magic spells. Hints towards some of these combinations can be found inside treasure chests or by talking to townspeople."

Al igual que ocurriría con otro de los títulos de igual género procedentes de la misma compañía, Fatal Fury (1991), Art of Fighting establecería una nueva saga, seguida por millones de aficionados en todo el mundo.

Incorporaba elementos que lo diferenciaban del título estrella de Capcom:

A nivel de diseño presentaba un modo de juego basado en una historia más compleja y que relacionaba a todos los personajes.

A nivel de metodología de juego añadía una nueva barra de energía (una especie de ki), además de la barra de vida del personaje, con lo que se limitaba el uso de golpes especiales, sólo mientras el personaje tuviera dicha barra disponible (se podía recargar).

A nivel técnico añadía un sistema de encuadre de la acción, de tal forma que permitía ver de cerca a los personajes cuando tenían contacto cuerpo a cuerpo, mediante un efecto de escalado (o zoom). Cabe destacar el enorme tamaño de los personajes, que ocupaban toda la pantalla.

Fue el primer cartucho de NeoGeo que alcanzó la simbólica cifra de 100 Mbits (tenía 102 Mb), algo nunca visto en ningún otro juego hasta la fecha.

The Legend of the Holy Sword Continues...

Formerly, when the world was enshrouded in darkness, the Mana Goddess ussed the Mana sword to destroy the 8 Mana beasts that intended to destroy the world, and sealed them into 8 Mana stones. Thus the darkness dissipated, and the world was reborn. The Mana Goddess turned herself into a tree, and went to sleep.

Many years passed. But then, the 8 seals started to dissolve, and the Mana beasts were free. They now aim to gain power enough to rival the gods. Meanwhile, due to greedy people who want to make the world their own, wars have started to break out...

The Super Nintendo release suffered from censorship, space limitations, and time constraints. The 2018 remake’s script was heavily derivative of its predecessor, adding only a fraction of the remaining content and leaving thousands of words untranslated. Finally, even Seiken Densetsu 2’s script is often vague and inconsistent, due in no small part to the game’s erratic development. An opportunity has been taken not only to localize the script, but also to explore and iron out some of these elements.

This patch features:-
A complete retranslation of the original Japanese script, the first of its kind
Some minor alterations that clarify vagaries and inconsistencies in the text and the plot itself
New events and content based on exhaustive research of authentic external materials, most of which were never translated into English
Memorable elements of both Ted Woolsey’s script and the Japanese script

Originally released for the Super Famicom in 1992 in Japan, it has been ported to multiple systems and eventually released in the West for iOS in 2014. It is the third game in the Megami Tensei series and the first in the central Shin Megami Tensei series. The gameplay uses first-person navigation of dungeons and turn-based battles against demons. The player can recruit demons as allies by talking to them rather than fighting them, and two to three demons can be fused to create new demons.

The story is set in Tokyo in the year 199X. Demons from the nether-realm of Makai have found their way back to Earth, and as such have upset the balance of power. A charismatic Japanese leader attempts a coup d'état using these demons as a potent military force, forcing America to intervene with its military. The player, as the hero, becomes involved when sent a Devil Summoning Program via email which allows him to converse with and recruit demons to fight for him, storing them as digital data on his computer.

In the aftermath of the ensuing destruction, the hero must decide what kind of world should be created on its ruins. Will he side with the angels and create a kingdom of absolute order that would last for a thousand years, or will he side with the demons and bring about an eternal anarchy, or will he choose neither, and destroy everyone who opposes him?"

In order to get vengeance on his peers he performs a ceremony in the gym (most likely referencing the original Megami Tensei) that transports his high school into Makai, the netherworld, where he has somehow become powerful enough to become Majin-Nou (Demon God Emperor). Back at the school, everyone freaks out and is scared except for a select few.The player assumes the role a nameless male or female student, who armed themselves with defensive equipment and COMP. They investigate the realms of Makai which are based on 5 of the 7 deadly sins, and finally face off against Hazama. In their quest, the player will be accompanied by fellow students and demons recruited through either negotiation or from the process of fusion, or via the Jakyou.There are four possible paths in the game, but unlike the previous games, they are not decided by the alignment system. Instead, right in the beginning of the game the player must choose one of the four main characters as a companion to investigate the misterious events and the Makai. Each main character has a defined path and once one has been chosen, the player is locked on that path. Yumi, Reiko and Charlie visit the worlds based off the deadly sins (Yumi and Reiko visit the same worlds, Charlie visits a few different ones), while Akira puts the player in an entirely different setting. Akira's path is much more difficult and, instead of being segmented among worlds, is composed by just one huge tower very similar to Persona 3's Tartarus. This path focuses much more heavily on the 'Dungeon Crawler' aspect of the game.Each of the worlds raise a few philosophical questions about the nature and consequences of the deadly sins, but the game presents these conflicts in a non-theological manner."

You set off in your little submarine and board the ship where a horde of passengers desperately need your keen oversight and ""shipsmarts"".

In 60 levels you have to rescue as many passengers (dubbed the Dim Passengers) as possible. At the beginning the passengers fall through a tube in the level. Similar to Lemmings you have to find a way for the passengers to the exit of the level. In order to do so, you must blast hindrances such cargo boxes and bulkheads with bombs or, when no bombs are left, reposition the boxes with a crane. There are also conveyor belts in the levels. If the belt moves in the wrong way, the passengers either can't use it or may even be transported to their dooms, being dropped off into water, fire or steam jets. You can usually choose the direction of the belts by pulling a lever.

There are several types of scenarios that Kevin Codner (you) are faced with throughout the game. Of course the puzzles get progressively more difficult, involving things like patching up cracked pipes to stop a lethal jet of steam from cooking the distressed passengers. You can blast away obstacles and stack crates in creative manners. For instance, you can have them fall onto each other to form a bridge across a gap or to provide shielding from fire. This is usually done by hoisting them onto conveyor belts using a crane.

Each level has a certain ""save limit"", meaning you have to save at least a certain amount of passengers. This again is akin a bit towards Lemmings, and lots of levels have a built-in time limit, represented be water pouring into the compartment, rising ominously.

"Sink or Swim","","Region Not Set","","Mindscape, Inc.","Titus","1994-01-01","1","No","Strategy","","Your name is Kevin Codner – rescue mariner extraordinaire, answering the distress call of a sinking cruise liner, the SS Lucifer. You set off in your little submarine and board the ship where a horde of passengers desperately need your keen oversight and ""shipsmarts"".

In 60 levels you have to rescue as many passengers (dubbed the Dim Passengers) as possible. At the beginning the passengers fall through a tube in the level. Similar to Lemmings you have to find a way for the passengers to the exit of the level. In order to do so, you must blast hindrances such cargo boxes and bulkheads with bombs or, when no bombs are left, reposition the boxes with a crane. There are also conveyor belts in the levels. If the belt moves in the wrong way, the passengers either can't use it or may even be transported to their dooms, being dropped off into water, fire or steam jets. You can usually choose the direction of the belts by pulling a lever.

There are several types of scenarios that Kevin Codner (you) are faced with throughout the game. Of course the puzzles get progressively more difficult, involving things like patching up cracked pipes to stop a lethal jet of steam from cooking the distressed passengers. You can blast away obstacles and stack crates in creative manners. For instance, you can have them fall onto each other to form a bridge across a gap or to provide shielding from fire. This is usually done by hoisting them onto conveyor belts using a crane.

Each level has a certain ""save limit"", meaning you have to save at least a certain amount of passengers. This again is akin a bit towards Lemmings, and lots of levels have a built-in time limit, represented be water pouring into the compartment, rising ominously. When the water rises high enough, the passengers will get carried along with it, and they can only swim for a short period of time before getting exhausted and drowning, so you'd better be on time with some assistance.

At the end of each level you receive a password (again, Lemmings-style) so that you may pick up your game from the current level without having to progress through them all from the get-go."

For example, Apple’s two abilities are CARDKEY and SCREAM. Using CARDKEY next to a door will cause it to open and detract one CARDKEY point (you need at least one point to open a door). Her SCREAM stuns nearby enemies for a short period of time.

All three players must be alive and to the exit to complete the level. If you get yourself stuck, press START to pause and then SELECT to restart the level.

The premise was wacky yet simple. You play as Socks the Cat, or Socks as we affectionately call him.  The ultimate pet of the 90's. The White House cat. The ""First Pet"" of the Clinton administration.  Your mission? To fight your way through the White House battling all sorts of enemies, including spies, Dobermans, protestors and satirical versions of famous political figures as end bosses. The game was set to be released on the ever popular, Super Nintendo Entertainment System or SNES in the early 90's. 

The game was well received by some, disliked by others, but all agreed it was a great theme with excellent end bosses.  Several publications reviewed the game but when the publisher closed its doors, Socks went missing.  For years. And years. And years.

20+ years later some retro gamers and enthusiasts wondered what happened to Socks and started asking questions.  There were some disagreements.  The developer said it was complete while former employees of the publisher whole-heartedly disagreed, saying the game was nowhere near completion.

Then in 2011 things got really interesting. A private collector allowed a friend to shoot some video footage and upload it to YouTube of what appeared to be the Socks the Cat video game.  Instant vitriol would follow.  While some were happy there was finally proof of the existence of the long lost game, others were upset that the collector would not release the game for others to enjoy. One thing was clear, the 20 years of speculation were over.  Socks did exist. This created even more questions.

Was it complete? Did it play well? What was the plan for it? Well those answers would start to be answered in 2012 when another collector, Tom Curtin, purchased the only known copy of Socks.  His plans were simple, he wanted to release the game. He has since teamed up with retro video game publisher, Second Dimension. Finally, hope. 

Curtin would acquire the rights to Socks the Cat a couple of years later and pursue the release.  He hired a dream team of retro game experts. A publisher, a programmer, an artist, and two experts in releasing previously unreleased games.  They would work together to bring Socks the Cat, the most anticipated unreleased game of all-time to reality. And we're off!!"

Designer Toshio Iwai was inspired by his earlier interactive installation art piece titled Music Insects, to develop a video game at Nintendo between 1993 and late 1994. The completed product was inexplicably canceled by Nintendo, and the game's key elements were later developed into Maxis's 1996 PC game release titled SimTunes.

Sound Fantasy contains eccentric concepts and untested game mechanics. Music games, especially on home consoles, were not popular in the early 1990s, and it wouldn't be until much later in the decade that they gained mainstream attention.[citation needed] The Sound Fantasy prototype contains four different games in one cartridge.

Pix Quartet was inspired by Toshio Iwai's Music Insects. There are four insects of different colors, where the player can select different insect to each represent a different instrument. They crawl all over the screen, where the player can draw. Insects that crawl over a colored pixel make a note. Each color represents a different note for each insects. Sample Demos can be loaded to demonstrate the capabilities of this game.

Beat Hopper contains three different modes: A-type, B-type and Training. A-type is a rhythm game in the style of Q-bert, where an insect on a pogo must make every block disappear after stepping on it as many times needed. Each block makes its own sound and the order does not matter. The player can improvise a song with each block. B-type requires the player to follow a path of blocks that appears every time the player touches one. The player must make as many steps as possible without losing three lives.

Ice Sweeper indicates two modes: A-type and B-type. This game is a Breakout clone with a few new twists added after a few stages, such as four bats controlled by a single player.

Star Fly is inspired by music boxes, where the player can set a sequence of stars in the sky, to compose a song. A higher star corresponds to a higher musical note. The player may set the speed and the tone."

"Supapoon","","Region Not Set","","Yutaka","Now Production Co.","1995-10-06","","No","Action","","A cutesy Breakout clone developed exclusively for the Japanese Super Famicom.

Supapoon is a Super Famicom game released late in 1995 that presents a colorful world with an elastic blue hero reminiscent of a Dragon Quest slime. The hero's solar system has been invaded by a group of yellow balls wearing triangular shades, and he jumps into action to send them packing.

Supapoon is inspired by games like Breakout and Arkanoid, but offers a few twists of its own, like being able to project the ball with additional power by using the ""paddle""'s intrinsic elasticity, and a constant timer that ticks down faster whenever the paddle takes damage from skull drops or enemy attacks.

The goal of the game is to reflect a ball of energy around a table, ensuring that it doesn't fall off the bottom of the screen. Rather than clearing all the blocks on the screen, which is common for other games of this type, the player only has to remove the yellow balls wearing shades to clear a level. They will receive a bonus for clearing the screen, however.

Occasionally, items will drop from the destroyed blocks. These include extending and shrinking the paddle, adding more balls, extra lives and power stars. By collecting power stars, the player can increase the strength that the ball leaves the paddle, causing more damage to blocks. If the player finds four stars, this charged up bounce will clear the screen.

Skulls can often drop from blocks too, and collecting these will lower a green gauge at the side of the screen, which operates as a combined timer/health bar."

It was published by Toho in 1992 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System as part of the Aleste series. In a traditional fashion, the player pilots a spaceship through a variety of locales crawling with enemy squadrons to shoot down, though the story in the Japanese version is different from the American and European one. Super Aleste also offers a ""Short Game"", featuring short segments of the regular levels, with the emphasis on scoring as many points as possible.

The story differs slightly depending on which version is played, though the opening premise is always the same.

In the year 2048, a large mechanical sphere falls from space and starts attacking major cities around the world. After much destruction, the sphere hovers over the jungles of South America, drawing lines into the ground similar to the Nazca Line drawings as it expands itself and draws energy from the jungle foliage. Equipped with its own defense system, The Sphere destroys all attacks made on it by Earth's military. The original Aleste fighter ship's failure to stop the sphere's growth prompts the construction of a space fighter capable of wielding amazing weaponry, that fighter being the Super Aleste. Tasked with flying into and destroying the sphere, the Super Aleste must also destroy any reinforcements the sphere calls for which come from the deepest depths of space.

In the original Japanese story, the Super Aleste is piloted by an ace named Raz and his co-pilot is a mysterious young alien woman named Thi, a prisoner aboard the sphere who harnesses strange powers freed by the constant attacks against the sphere. Thi's role in the game is to fly with Raz into the sphere, weaken its defenses and properly wrest the sphere's power source. The presence of both characters, and thus the game's original ending, were cut from Space Megaforce and the European version of Super Aleste."

Use your whip like a grappling hook and swing past hundreds of traps and a host of ghost freaks, living corpses and hidden goblins. All while dodging or destroying the unpredictable spitting lizards, carnivorous coffins, and more.
Find the concealed weapons needed to defeat everything from eerie phantoms to haunted furniture. Then prepare to find yourself face-to-thing with hideous torments like the Tongue Lasher, the Darkest Knight, the Bone-Afide Horseman and the Granite Crusher. When your nerves get shot, use your password and take a breather. But forge on, Simon Belmont, because if you though Dracula was down for the count, he's only just begun to fright!"

"Super Chase H.Q.","","Region Not Set","","Taito Corporation","Taito Corporation","1993-01-01","1","No","Racing","","Super Chase H.Q. is an enhanced sequel to Chase H.Q. As usual, you must drive your way towards a criminal's vehicle, which is known to be involved in some crime, while avoiding passing cars to gain points. Your car also comes equipped with three turbos, which can be useful if you are way behind the vehicle.

But this time, cars aren't just the only things that you have to worry about. You will also encounter bikes that shoot or throw firebombs at you, as well as cars that go the wrong way. (If you crash into one of these, you'll be sent flying through the air.) Not to mention other obstacles such as barricades.

Furthermore, as well as the criminal's damage indicator, you also have your own. When you finally catch up with each criminal,  they are likely to shoot at you if you get too close to their vehicle, but you may encounter criminals who have different ways of attacking you. The fourth criminal, for example, launches a missile at you if you are further behind him. Once you are shot at and hit, your indicator decreases for every time you are hit, but this rule does not apply when you're hit by passing cars. When your indicator is empty or when you're out of time, the game ends.

When you complete each round, a statistics screen will appear, and you are awarded points based on the time remaining, how much damage you've done, and the number of nitros that are used. One of the options allow you to display the game's speedometer in either MPH or Km/h. The game also has a storyline, which can be viewed in between rounds."

The game is a traditional top-down racing game that emphasizes sim elements, such as selecting the car's various parts and ensuring that the rules of the race are followed. If the player causes too many infractions, or too much damage is caused to six vital instruments on the car, they will be forced out of the race.

Super Bonk allows Bonk to travel through time from his prehistoric levels, the insides of a dinosaur, a version of modern Chinatown, and even the moon! Along the way, Bonk can find power-ups that can change his form to creatures such as a shooting Bonk crab, a dinosaur form called ""Big Kronk"", find candies that change his size from tiny to huge, travel through transportation tubes, and find multiple bonus levels. Bonk still uses his head to smash his enemies, propeller seeds that allow Bonk to fly, and for the first time, can carry spring flowers on his head in his continuing battle against his arch nemesis, King Drool!"

It is the sequel to Super Bonk in the Bonk series, and the only platform game in the series never to be released outside Japan.

In this sidescrolling action-platformer, Bonk is once again trying to save his world from the evil clutches of the reptilian king, who once more is threatening the prehistoric era.  Boy, you'd think that after being defeated four times prior that he would take a hint.  This time, you also get to face his five best soldiers, who will try to stop you in your tracks.  Bonk controls rather smoothly, and he is really fun to control.  To those of you that are not familiar with the series, Bonk is a caveman who attacks his enemies with his noggin; after jumping down, from below, while swimming, and while in the air.  He can even bounce off walls with his head, skip on the water like a stone if his head is facing down, climb certain walls with his teeth, scale up waterfalls, flip in the air (so long as the attack button is repeatedly being tapped), and so forth.  As is the case with the series, you start with a regular amount of health, but if you find a translucent heart icon, you'll increase your capacity.  What's neat is how collecting the food not only scores you some points but how it also replenishes a little bit of your health, too.  This time Bonk can also run if you hold down the A button, and the X button is used if you have a special ability on you.  If you find a power-up, whether it be piece of meat, or a different icon, then you will be given a power-up ability that will be taken out the moment you're hit once (damn).  Among the power-ups are the one where the fire will be spreading if Bonk hits his head on the ground (you know, the one where he looks freaky), one where Bonk turns into a bird and gains the ability to fly, one where Bonk becomes tiny and can make platforms made out of Japanese characters, and there is one where Bonk has the ability to double-jump as a girl.  Yes, Bonk becomes a girl if he eats the pink-colored meat.  I'm dead serious."

CD (SMBCD) is a rom hack of Super Mario World that is a ""what if"" of sorts for a SMB game on a CD based console! The CD based console in this situation is the FamicomCD, which is a fictional add-on for the Famicom/NES and is not the Super NES CD, which some people seem to mix up.

SMBCD functions off of MSU-1 to deliver high quality and rich CD quality audio created exclusively for SMBCD, as well as fully animated cutscenes and more complex level environments in some cases. SMBCD also heavily utilizes Mode 0 for its levels, providing more layers for foreground environments and background parallax. Mode 0 is a background mode for the Super NES that allows 4 layers at once, but will cause all layers to be in 2BPP or 4 colors per tile (this does not include sprite layers and they retain their 16 colors).

SMBCD takes place upon the small yet diverse Archipelago of Brixurei. Mysteriously, the main source of protection and security for the archipelago, The Guardian of Brixurei, had gone mad, causing poor weather and upset wildlife to run rampant. Locals were left baffled and worried. Those who had attempted to find out what was going on by departing from their towns were never heard from since.

Due to the chaos that was being caused by the Guardian's berserk nature, the locals called upon the one and only Mario to help them. With the Mushroom Kingdom wishing farewells, Mario set off by boat towards the Archipelago of Brixurei, bringing Luigi along for the ride. In this journey, the brothers will also meet a new friendly face who will accompany them."

Super Mario World is often considered one of the best games in the series and is cited as one of the greatest video games ever made. It sold more than twenty million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling SNES game. It also led to an animated television series of the same name and a 1995 sequel, Yoshi's Island. The game has been re-released on multiple occasions: It was part of the 1994 compilation Super Mario All-Stars + Super Mario World for the SNES and was re-released for the Game Boy Advance as Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2 in 2001, on the Virtual Console for the Wii, Wii U, and New Nintendo 3DS consoles, and as part of the Super NES Classic Edition.

Although plumbers by trade, Mario and Luigi (2 brothers) live in the Mushroom Kingdom. Not far from there, at the castle, live Princesses Peach and Daisy, as well as Toad, the King's advisor. Little by little, bonds and even feelings are formed, making Peach and Mario, Daisy and Luigi, much more than friends. But without knowing why and without warning signs, it seems that Bowser is preparing to attack. He forms the ranks, prepares his henchmen, trains each recruit for an imminent attack. Worried about the residents of the castle, Luigi goes ahead and intends to avoid a tragedy... but once there, it is already too late ! Bowser has already kidnapped the Princesses and destroyed their castle ! On the way back to the Dark Valley, Bowser even stole the Yoshis' eggs ! Arriving late, Mario arrives at the scene of the tragedy. The castle is nothing but ruins, and no one is there anymore... not even Luigi who probably went ahead to catch up with Bowser and save his beloved, as well as his friends. In turn, Mario heads to the Dark Valley, because Bowser must answer for his actions ! It is now up to him to save the Princesses as well as Toad, perhaps even on the road he will find traces of his brother. And in this long adventure, he will surely find new allies ready to help him...

Features:-

Presence of a hidden store ! We wanted to do something more RPG (like the coins collected are used to buy items) but it's difficult to achieve without deeply tinkering with the game code
There are 12 new songs just for Bowser's Castle and a level that lasts at least 45 minutes ! Epic you say ?
Changing the intro and prologue music (and Lunar Magic users know that it's not easy to do ^.^)
The reserve item no longer automatically goes down when you get hit (and that's really handy !)
Changed the music for P-switch, invincibility and mini-intros (""no Yoshi"", Castle or Ghost-house)
There are no more congas when you take a Yoshi (that would have been out of place with most music)
The world map is more or less open-world ! We don't have to play the game in a prescribed order
Change of all texts : message box in the levels, post-boss cut-scenes, intro message, end credits...
There are 11 tutorials which remind you of the basics of the game + 5 optional levels
Lowering the checkpoint bar... this is just one small detail among many others
Time is no longer limited and score has been removed
Implementation of a real prologue to the adventure

What is it?

As the name implies, Super Metroid: Eris is a Super Metroid hack. It was created by DigitalMantra and is probably the most artistically impressive hack out there. Super Metroid has a vast tileset and effects library which has been put to some extremely creative uses here; the hack author also made numerous graphical edits, which are almost entirely seamless with the original art. The result is a highly atmospheric hack with numerous distinct and characterful environments. The hack also has a few minor changes to the game engine, the most notable being that you can start spinning in midair without having to touch ground again.

The challenge level is mostly pretty reasonable, but it can be uneven at parts, especially in the early part of the game before Samus can gear up a bit. In particular, the second and third bossfights are punishingly lethal and have limited room to maneuver. This is also a hack that expects you to have full control of Samus; you don't need to pull off any glitches, but you do need to be able to walljump and midair morph.

Finally, this is the 2012 edition of the hack. Compared to the original edition (published in 2009, I believe), some items and barriers have been moved around to tweak the item sequence, and a few small areas were added. I don't think there's a good reason to play the 2009 version at this point, in particular because it leads with a lengthy suitless underwater section."

"Super Metroid Redux","","NTSC","","","","2021-11-01","1","No","Adventure | Role-Playing | Unofficial","Not Rated","Super Metroid Redux is an improvement hack for Super Metroid, and a continuation of Super Metroid: GBA Style.

This hack aims to give Super Metroid a whole lot of improvements, being it graphical or in mechanics/gameplay, and address some of the annoyances from the original.

These are some of the changes that you can find in Super Metroid Redux:

    All of the improvements/changes made for Super Metroid: GBA Style are present here with a more refined touch, minus the mandatory Heavy Physics (which are now an optional patch). For more details on the full changelog from GBA Style which is included on Redux, visit GBA Style’s release page on RH.net.
    A lot of features from Project Base 0.7.3 have been implemented. (Like faster door transitions and speeds, instant Bomb explosion by holding Down on the D-Pad, Game time and Item percentage can now be seen in the Pause menu, etc).
    Normal and Hard mode can be toggled within the “Difficulty Settings” before selecting a save file (NOTE: The difficulty change can ONLY be enabled when starting a New Game, by Sylandro)
    Special Demo sequences that depict useful tricks and abilities (from SM Turbo)
    Message boxes can be skipped by pressing a button
    Screw Attack now destroys frozen enemies (by Adamf)
    X-Ray Visor range widened
    Unlock Tourian patch has been completely fixed, so it doesn’t play the Super Metroid eating the side-hopper cutscene every time you go through that room on Tourian. Now the game only plays that scene the first time you go through it, sets a correct flag, and the Super Metroid and its two adjacent rooms will play the normal Tourian theme AFTER the cutscene has already happened (shoutouts to Smiley, PJBoy and the people from the Metroid Construction Discord for the help)
    Charge Beam combos can be triggered by fully charging your beam with the beam of choice, and then pressing Select
    Crystal Flash is still enabled like in the original game
    Elevator Speed has been increased to double the speed of the original in Super Metroid
    MSU-1 playback integrated
    Missile Stations have now been changed to Recharge Stations. They now refill your entire weapons’ stack (Missiles, Super Missiles, Power Bombs) upon touching them with the message “Weapons Reload Completed.” (similar to Zero Mission / Fusion)
    Power Bombs reveal hidden tiles (like in Zero Mission / Fusion)
    Fanfare music for normal expansion tanks (Missiles, Super Missiles, Power Bombs, Energy and Reserve Tanks) now use a special SFX when grabbed which is shorter, to allow for a more fluid play session. Main items like beams, suits, and the first main Missile/Super Missile/Power Bomb items still play the long-normal fanfare (similar to Zero Mission / Fusion)
    Combined DC’s Map Patch with Scyzer’s Item Circles code to create a meticulously completely revamped Map system to be more in-line or similar to what is seen in both Zero Mission / Fusion. (Entrances, colour-coded doors, item circles/dots, etc)."

Ancient Chozo started from Project Base Hack, but it's not the same,
it has new color palette for the entire game, and even more places to explore plus
new custom enemies, moves, puzzles, music, and some few more stuff
The new routes makes the game more interesting and more fun to explore.
My intention was to keep the original route of Vanilla and add some new routes that can curious players could find,
and also the players with good skills can break the Game Sequence.
The gameplay now rewards both types of players,
those who likes going faster, can now beat the game faster than cause they have new shortcuts and new routes to travel between each area much faster!
On the other hand, those who like exploring or breaking the game sequence, now gets most of the upgrades and power ups! Although it's a task not to easy to perform!

Chozo Hack focused on Explorations and most of the original items locations has been changed!
There's a lot of new secrets to discover, new areas, new rooms and no longer have the help of the X-Ray vision, but there's a new feature find them, so the players can feel curious finding new secrets and upgrades using a different method, so that makes the adventure even more interesting and enjoyable.

The gameplay is vaguely influenced by Lemmings, as the levels are populated by lots of points which can't be crossed in all forms - walls, fires, gaps, thornbushes and suchlike. You get a set number of transformations on each level, although extra ones can be picked up at times, and there are heaters and freezers dotted around which cause transformations in some states. All this is done against a time limit. Like Lemmings 2, you can take on the next level in each of the worlds at any time, so you have to be stuck 4 times before you can't progress."

It was succeeded by Super Nazo Puyo Tsu: Rulue no Tetsuwan Hanjouki. A Nuisance Puyo variation known as Iron Puyo was introduced in this game.

Super Nazo Puyo: Rulue no Roux uses the basic rules of Puyo Puyo. The game controls like a normal Puyo Puyo game with all five colors available and the ability to roate clockwise and counter clockwise, except the ability to double rotate and climb is not possible. Each puzzle gives the player different objectives to clear. The objectives range from clearing all of a specific color of Puyo, clearing all Nuisance Puyo, creating a specific chain length, clearing a certain amount of Puyo simultaneously, or simply clear the whole board. Every time the player fails to complete a puzzle, the player's health will deplete, as indicated by Arle or Rulue's expression gradually getting more distressed. If the player's health depletes completely, they'll receive a Game Over and can either choose to continue from the last save or quit back to the title. The player can recover completely if the gauges on the right side of the screen fills completely and rank up, with each cleared puzzle filling it gradually. On the pause menu, the player has the option to skip a puzzle at the cost of health.

There are five game modes: Arle's Roux, Rulue's Roux, Road to Chains, Endless Puyo, and Editor. In the first three modes, the player must solve the presented tasks with a set of available Puyo. Arle's Roux focuses on a scenario with Arle, acting as the normal course with her puzzles only involving standard Puyo. Rulue's Roux is the mode that focuses on Rulue and acts as the expert mode, with her puzzles including Iron Puyo and Blocks. In both modes, the objective is to clear puzzle sets from varies characters within an area, with one character acting as a boss that cannot be challenged until the others are beaten. Once the boss of a given area is beaten, the player will progress to the next area. Road to Chains acts as a challenge mode where the player is given a series of puzzles to solve at a gradually increasing difficulty, with the player being unable to restore health.

The Endless Puyo mode is a regular endless mode except that 6 next Puyo are shown instead of 1 next Puyo, and that nuisance Puyo will fall in the higher levels of difficulty. The Editor mode allows you to place Puyo freely in a manner similar to Practice Notebook in Puyo Puyo 7. You can also set a list of next Puyo and the task to be solved."

The game contains familiar role-playing elements such as equipping differing kinds of weapons, equipment and gaining levels. The Ninja Boys are treated as a single entity and so these statistics are shared between Jack and Ryu with equal values. Battles with the enemy, either through random encounters or visible on the map is where the action starts. The characters enter a side-scrolling 'battle mode' where they may jump, fight, use their special techniques, items and spells, as well as activate various bonuses on the battlefield by breaking open the bonus boxes. A battle is over and experience points awarded when a pre-determined number of enemies are defeated or the Ninja Boys are defeated.

When bosses are encountered, the gameplay changes to a turn-based system. Each turn, commands are given to Jack and Ryu, which include usage of special items and skills acquired during the game, who then perform actions based on those commands. The enemy's turn takes place the same way. The battle ends when one side of the conflict runs out of hitpoints."

I learned a lot by studying the example files from ‘alekmaul’ and sourcecodes from the games of ‘Dr. Ludos’. Thank you.

And thank you to my family, especially to my kids and 'Jonas' for testing and giving design tips.

There are some ideas left to realize and some glitches to remove (I had to handle some problems with the colision- and VRAM-functions), but I´m happy with the result. A dream of my childhood (to have a developing part in a SNES Game) is realized.

About the developing theme 'perspective' of the game jam: Our rambler wants to reach a place witch he has a good perspective / view for his rest. I've tried to build the map with different perspectives / segments.

I learned a lot about retro technics and limitations (I had to implement less details then I'd wanted to put in the map). And I refreshed my C-coding skills. I'm planing to improve this project step by step.

Creating a line entirely out of one color will clear all blocks on the screen of that color. There are also grey pieces, which can only be cleared by creating a line made entirely from one color, which will cause all grey blocks on screen to become that color. There are also rare rainbow pieces which will act as any color. Besides these additions, the game itself is basic Tetris.

Sadly, there weren't any SNES game jams this year, so we took matters into our own hands and had a little #SnesDevParty in the rural Eifel uplands in western Germany instead.
Of course, a proper SNES title needs to be on physical cartridges, so we set up a micro-production-run of 16 handcrafted copies, too.

One of the neat things of this game is that the game boards have front and back sides, and you can affect one side with what you do on the other.

This game is undoubtedly the most polished of the four games entered in the SNESdev Game Jam. In some ways, the graphics style reminds me of Uniracers. The sound is good, and the implementation of a high pitched Japanese voice is a nice touch to make it feel like a Super Famicom game. The levels are fairly long, and there are a few trip-ups that means that you might be forced to reset. Keep an eye on the cracks in the floor, is all I will say!"

"Sutte Hakkun","","Region Not Set","","Nintendo","Indies Zero","1999-06-25","1","No","Platform","","Sutte Hakkun is a puzzle action game in the shape of a platformer. The playing character is an abundant-beaked bird resembling a penguin, named Hakkun, that is able to walk and jump but not to fly. The Rainbow of Happiness shined in the sky above Peaceful Islands: one day it broke apart and now Hakkun has to track down, collect, and put together all rainbow crystals to relive it. The gameplay hinges upon two elements: blocks and potions, the latter of several colours. Hakku makes its way through levels by changing the position of blocks — that will be done by swallowing them to release them on an other place then — and sucking potions — that are to be injected to blocks by the beak, endowing them with new properties consequential to the colour of the fluid — from jars. A level is cleared when the rainbow shards in it are collected. Neither a time limit nor enemy characters are there impeding Hakkun's way. Equally distinctive is the score system: a set number of points is given at the beginning of each level, and a decrease happens with any move made, thus rewarding the player for completing levels with as little moves as possible.

Before reaching the format of a common Super Famicom cartridge, the game was released for and downloadable by the console's add-on Satellaview in four versions. Given data size limitations, only one of the four of those, released for use with the Nintendo Power cartridge, could include all the levels designed by game creators: that is the one released as a Super Famicom standard cartridge later, and on Wii's Virtual console eventually."

It was the first Adventure Island game released for the SNES and came out between the releases of the NES games Adventure Island II and Adventure Island 3. It was later followed by Super Adventure Island II. The game's soundtrack was composed by Yuzo Koshiro.

Over the course of his adventures, Master Higgins managed to maintain the peace and tranquility of his home, the mystical Adventure Island, and even earned the love and support of the local ""Miss Jungle"", the lovely Tina (erroneously called ""Jeannie Jungle"" in English materials). At nighttime, the young hero was quietly enjoying a well-deserved rest with his grateful girlfriend Tina loyally leaning on his side atop a treetop (said to be stargazing in the English manual). When the warmth of Tina's soft touch suddenly becomes a chilling coldness, he turns around and is shocked to find that the evil sorcerer, Dark Cloak, used a spell to turn Tina into a stone statue for eternity. Dark Cloak retreats to the legendary Ice Mountain across the sea, and Higgins resolves to defeat the wicked sorcerer in order to restore her to life.

The player controls Higgins as he travels his way through five stages with four areas each. The first three areas in each stage has Higgins fighting his way through an obstacle course, fighting many traps and enemies, in order to reach the goal ball. The final area in each stage consists of a boss battle.

Other than the improved visuals and audio as a result of the switch of hardware to the SNES, the rules of the game are not much different from the original Adventure Island. Although released shortly after Adventure Island II for the NES, Master Higgins' dinosaur companions are not present in this installment. However, Higgins now has a choice between two weapons: the standard stone axe from previous games and a boomerang (which was later introduced in Adventure Island 3). Whereas the axe can only be tossed left or right, Higgins can shoot the boomerang in four directions (up and down, as well as left and right). When Higgins first picks a weapon, he can only toss one shot at a time. By picking up the same weapon in a row, Higgins can toss up to three shots consecutively. When Higgins picks a fourth weapon of the same kind, his shots will turn into fireballs, which are more powerful and capable of destroying stones. At this point, when the player switches from axes to boomerangs or vice versa, the fireball effect will remain in place until the player loses a life. While Higgins has lost the ability to run faster in this game, he has gained the ability to crouch, which can be followed up with a super-jump. During gameplay, Master Higgins must collect tropical fruit in order to keep his life bar from depleting; he also can acquire a skateboard which will allow him to travel across the stage faster."

It is the first title in Namco's Tales series. Initially released for the Super Famicom in December 1995.

In ""Tales of Phantasia"", you play a young boy named Cless, who lives together with his parents in a quiet village. It was a day like all the others when Cless decided to go hunting with his best friend Chester. Chasing a wild boar, Cless discovered a strange talking tree in the forest who was pleading him for help. But as soon as it stopped speaking, the two friends heard the sound of an alarm. They returned to the village and found it burnt down, and all its inhabitants murdered. Before Cless' mother died in his arms, she told him this terrible massacre had something to do with the pendant she and her husband gave Cless for his birthday... what connection could there be? Cless decides to visit his uncle who lives in another town, but he doesn't realize his journey will take him to much more remote places than that!

The game's main claim to fame is its intro theme, which incorporates a vocal track. Normally, such a track cannot be done on the SNES, as all assets for a single song must fit into the 64kB audio buffer before the song can be played. This technical limit was overcome by slicing the vocal track into small samples and swapping them in and out of the audio buffer. The rest of the intro theme is standard MIDI.

""Tales of Phantasia"" presents a unique combat system. The battles have a lot in common with fighting games: you fight on a platform that slowly scrolls forward and have to attack your enemy in real time. Other party members are controlled by AI. You can pause the game at any time and use magic, items, or choose an overall strategy for your allies."

With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.

While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters.

There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel)."

At one point it even serves as a switch for opening the door.

Puzzledude was concentrating to change the gameplay as much as possible, so even a veteran of the game can easily get stuck. The game is also more difficult than the original, but still quite easy at some points. Despite the fact that this is a remodel, it still took a lot of work, specially because of the number of the dungeons. The overworld, however, is less modified, but there are a lot of barriers, that will force you to search for the correct path.

This version aims to keep consistence with the overall franchise, along with converting some of the odd palette/sprite choices that didn’t match the original artwork of the game.

Some of the changes are:

    Change Link’s hair and hat to closely match his original artwork.
    Change Agahnim colours to match the original red robe and blue skin artwork.
    Changed Uncle’s sprite to match official artwork.
    Change the Flute’s name to Ocarina (I don’t know in what world that instrument is a flute). This includes in-game text and Credits name changed too.
    Change the Good Bee’s name to Golden Bee.
    Change Faerie to Fairy. This includes in-game text too.
    Change Pegasus Shoes to Pegasus Boots. This includes in-game text too.
    Change all the references of the “Wise Men” to “Sages”.
    Change the layout of the Ice Palace to that of the GBA port. No more going around the entire palace just to get to the next room!
    King of Hyrule now has a red outfit instead of green to match the rest of the franchise’s Kings of Hyrule (Like Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule from WW)."

This hack was made to provide a new adventure in Hyrule. As such, much of the world will have a similar feel to the original while providing new challenges, a different route, and possibly a new trick.
This hack has moderate modifications to the overworld, offering a new look to familiar spaces. Some text has been modified to match this different world. All dungeons were modified, leading to new routes, different big chest items, new puzzles, and increased difficulty. Reflecting the increased difficulty, all that remains of your uncle is a pile of clothes and his sword. Bomb jumping is not required. Save states are not required to complete this journey.

The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.

The player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses them all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and the level must be restarted."

Super attacks damage all enemies on-screen, but can only be used twice per continue. If a character is hit repeatedly, there is a chance that they temporarily switch into ""angry-mode"" during which they are invincible and more powerful.

""The Second Reality Project Reloaded"" is not another new entry in the TSRP-series, it's a remake of the first part. The hack finally features a new overworld (people requested this for years) and of course, custom graphics and custom music. Besides that, not much have changed, most of the time the level design is the same as before. So, keep in mind that the original hack came out back in 2002, and back in the days you don't had the possibility to insert custom sprites, dozens of ASM-hacks and so on. So please don't expect anything groundbreaking here, it's still the same thing as it was before: a hack which is about level design and nothing else. But with that said, chances are if you enjoyed the original hack, you will love the remake for sure!

He found a power source which let him rebuilt his Airship Fleet. Soon he plans on attacking the Mushroom Kingdom one time more! It's up to Mario to stop him!"

Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.

Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest.

It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features."

Another nice feature is the color-coded collisions, especially during boss battles - blue impacts indicate that the player is not causing any damage to the enemy, but if they turn red, then he knows that he is inflicting damage (and that he has most certainly found a weak point).

The gameplay itself is a typical platforming action: Tintin walks through the levels while avoiding the enemies. Pretty much everyone, e.g. little girls and security guards, is out to hurt Tintin who has no means of defending himself. This means the most important aspect is learning enemy placements, their patterns and how to avoid them. But he has to hurry because of the time limit.

It might seem an odd combination, but it describes Uniracers perfectly. One of the more successful releases of the Super Nintendo's twilight era, Uniracers mixes platform-based high-speed racing, with crazy stunts and tricks.

The basic idea in most levels of the game is simple. Get your unicycle from A to B as quickly as possible, and finish ahead of your opponent. It's like Sonic, but with none of those pesky enemies, pointless power-ups and frustrating obstructions. In fact it doesn't sound like much of a game at all...

Here's the key, though. Tricks performed and landed during the race increase your speed. The better the trick, the greater your increase in speed will be.

Also, some levels are set in areas designed solely for stunts. Such levels require you to earn as many style points as possible, by doing tricks. These levels are against the clock, and a set points score, rather than an opponent.

Unicycles are stupid and difficult, and yet fun, once you get the hang of them. Much the same could be said about Uniracers..."

Something went wrong however, and three new life forms turned against their creators: Brutally savage Orcs, cybernetic androids called Cromes and genetically enhanced human soldiers code named M.A.R.S. Players take control of a secretly assembled force and must try to restore order.

War 2410 is a turn-based strategy game in which players move various units, such as mechs, tanks, troops or planes over a grid-map. Units differ in movement and attacking range. Some ground units cannot attack air units and vice versa. Terrain also affects combat as some types of terrain, like trees or buildings improve a units defense. Attacked units always counterattack as long as the attacker is within range. The goal of most missions is to destroy all enemy units, while it is sometimes necessary to capture the enemies' bases. Units cannot not be improved or modified and every mission starts with all units already in place."

War 3010 is a turn-based strategy game in which players move spaceships over a grid-map. There are different types of ships, such as Fighters, Marauders or Destroyers, that differ in movement range and weapon power. Weapon power is also divided into long and short range, i.e. a ship that is very good at long range combat may have poor close ranged weapons etc. During combat, the following actions can be chosen from a menu: Movement, Attacking, terrain information, unit information, a map of the battlefield, overview of all units, including those of the enemy; and an option to scout planets for technology. When an attacking unit is within range of an attacked unit, the attacked unit will always counter-attack (if it isn't destroyed first). In later missions it becomes possible to scout planets for technology and upgrade ships, as well as take control of space stations to build new ships. Ships cannot be taken into the next mission however."
"Waratte Iitomo! Tamorinpic","","Region Not Set","","Athena Co., Ltd.","","1994-04-28","","No","Action","","A Super Famicom four-player party mini-game collection based on the long-running Japanese variety show Waratte Iitomo! and featuring its shades-wearing host Tamori.

Waratte Iitomo! Tamorinpic (""It's OK to Laugh! Tamorinpic"") is a party mini-game collection based on the Japanese TV show of the same name. The show was a daily hour-long comedy variety show featuring recurring guests and various skits and interviews, hosted by the shades-wearing comedian Tamori (whose real name is Kazuyoshi Morita). It aired from 1982-2014 and made several longevity records in the process.

The game allows for up to four players, but only two players ever play at once: most of the mini-games are based on completing a task within a set time or with a certain amount of precision, so all players don't need to play simultaneously. Instead, the first pair of players will play each mini-game, followed by the second pair (or two-and-one, if the three-player mode was selected). These mini-games have a comedic edge to them and vary from bowling with a snooker cue to a Simon Says game that involves clapping the correct way to certain goofy poses Tamori makes.

Due to the license, the game was never released outside of Japan."

There are four different types of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything you’d logically expect to clear the path). You can avoid the baddies, which may be the best option, as killing them costs you some energy –this reduces the significance of the points system."

Set in the Wild West with steampunk and sci-fi influences, the story follows Annie and her bounty hunter Clint, seeking revenge for the death of her family. The player controls either Annie or Clint sidestepping and jumping in the foreground while shooting down enemy robots in the background and dodging enemy bullets. These gameplay mechanics combine elements from third-person shooters and light gun games.

Development lasted five months on a small budget with a team of only three core members and two support staff. The team leads had previously worked together on The Ninja Warriors (1994) for the Super NES, and so chose to develop for that system. Wild Guns was heavily influenced in its gameplay and artistic design by arcade games such as Blood Bros. and Dynamite Duke. The game's scenery, characters, and sound design drew ideas from the Western film genre and the science fiction manga Cobra, creating a space western setting.

Wild Guns received positive reviews at its initial release, and in retrospective reviews is considered a cult classic. Critics have praised the gameplay of what has become a niche genre, as well as the cooperative mode and graphical attention to detail. The game was rereleased on the Virtual Console for the Wii in 2010 and Wii U in 2014.

A snake will destroy any other snakes of the same color and pattern that it touches with its head on the way down, which often has the chain effect of loosening the pile of snakes so that all the snakes slither into new positions, possibly eliminating even more snakes.

The game is played against a selection of backgrounds including desert, forest, water, or grass. Further, there are 7 game grids including the standard grid (a tall rectangle), X, plus, flask, Diabolo (an hourglass pattern), T-square, and obstacle (with a number of intermediate blocks).

The player starts out as a nestling and earns higher and higher distinctions taken from the snake realm (garter snake, water snake, boa, mambo, python, king cobra, etc.) as more snakes are cleared. Also, as the level increases. more types of snake patterns must be handled. Sometimes, there is a flashing red snake that eliminates the first snake it touches. Further, there is occasionally an unstoppable snake that barrels down to the bottom of the space, eliminating all snakes in its path.

The game can be played with 1 or 2 players in either easy, normal or hard mode. In the single player mode, the player can choose whether the preview showing the next snake will be shown. In 2-player mode, there is always a preview window. In fact, there is a queue of 3 snakes between the 2 player spaces from which the next snake is drawn.

Your goal is to train PIno in various disciplines. His stats can be raised in a RPG style: reading books increases his intelligence, throwing a ball increases his dexterity, and so on.

Rather than create a new game from scratch, Sting opted to re-brand the already existing ""The Jetsons: Invasion of the Planet Pirates"" game they had released the year before, which had not been released in Japan. The gameplay and level design between the two games is ultimately the same, though the story, sprites, and artwork were completely redone, as well as music.

Ruka-chan was a fiesty teenage-looking demon girl that was actually over 1000 years old. Her task was to rid the world of demons and monsters that were causing more trouble than she was. Ruka's boss Enma, the Buddhist deity charged with judging the souls of the dead - an Asian St. Peter, as it were - is represented as a giant red oni in a business suit and jokingly referred to by Ruka as ""Elvis"". One night his body was stolen by a handsome boy known only as, well, ""Body"" to be used for nefarious purposes along with his army of monsters. Left with only his head, Enma scolds and demands Ruka to get his body back or else he'll gladly take hers as a replacement."

One or two players take control of the protagonists, Zeke and Julie, in order to rescue the titular neighbors from monsters often seen in horror movies. Aiding them in this task are a variety of weapons and power-ups that can be used to battle the numerous enemies in each level. Various elements and aspects of horror movies are referenced in the game with some of its more violent content being censored in various territories such as Europe and Australia, where it is known only as Zombies.

While not a great commercial success, the game was well-received for its graphical style, humor, and deep gameplay. It spawned a sequel, Ghoul Patrol, released in 1994. Both games were re-released as part of Lucasfilm Classic Games: Zombies Ate My Neighbors and Ghoul Patrol for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows in June 2021."

Notes:
-This hack requires you to be able to same wall walljump, infinite bomb jump, and mockball.
-To break out of knockback, mash the L and R buttons. Successfully doing so will play a sound and give you extra invulnerability frames.

Additional Features
--------------------
The ""X"" button will act as if you pressed both Down and Y, which will fire your selected special weapon while in the tank.
The ""R"" button will mirror the NES ""A"" button (the SNES B button), which shoots grenades and jumps.  This allows you to hold R to strafe in the overhead levels.
The ""L"" button will temporarily disable Wall.2 for the purposes of climbing down the corner of a wall.  This allows you to more easily jump off ledges rather than accidently clinging to the wall and falling to your death.

Additionally, the following Quality of Life options are available:
1. Choice of two palettes, the default Mesen2 NES palette, or the default FCEUX palette
2. Turn on hover recharge while idle - this will slowly fill your hover gauge as long as you're on the ground not moving.
3. Gun Degrade - FULL (1 bar lost per hit), or 1/4 (lose at 1/4 the rate, although the first hit will drop you down a level)
4. Continues - either unlimited or the original limit of 4
5. Lives - either unlimited or the original limit of 3
6. Saving - The game will automatically save periodically, including when you reach a new area or pick up a key item.  You can choose to load this save when you start the game, which will start you at the beginning of the area you were in, with your items, lives, continues, and sub weapon counts in tact.

You guide Mario through dusty temples, nudging blocks and hunting for barely-visible switches while that SNES soundtrack keeps things weirdly cozy. Half the time you're tapping walls like ""this HAS to be hiding something.""

You control Mario, moving him screen by screen through ancient ruins and overgrown forests, searching for hidden keys and artifacts. The main goal is to uncover every secret in each stage, which involves a lot of pushing blocks, lighting torches in a specific order, and studying backgrounds for subtle cracks. The pacing is deliberate, almost slow, and some puzzles can leave you stumped for a good while. It feels like working through a dense, interactive riddle where every small discovery brings a real sense of accomplishment."
