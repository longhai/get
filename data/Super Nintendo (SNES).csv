One of the more notable players in the game is Shunsuke Nakamura  who played for Tōkō Gakuen High School.

The game has some similarities with Hat Trick Hero, Aoki Densetsu Shoot! or any other soccer game with the left-right perspective, and Top Striker or Libero Grande because of the ability to play as just one player, instead of controlling the whole team. This feature would serve as a model for the ""career mode"" provided in most modern EA Sports games. There were many other improvements over the two original versions. One of the most important being the availability of creating and customizing an own character/football player and training with the instructor before each match, among other options. Coaches give out verbal reports that range between ""perfect"" and ""needs improvement.""

This game is a sequel to Zenkoku Kōkō Soccer and Zenkoku Kōkō Soccer 2."

The premise is that each world represents a different season — there's a Spring world, a Summer world, a Fall world, and a Winter world. (And some more!)

The core gameplay doesn't stray too far from the original Super Mario World, but almost all of the assets have been changed, and all are custom-made for this hack. I made all the graphics myself (which isn't often done), and some very kind people from the community have put together an original soundtrack. There's also a lot of custom programming done, which I partially did myself, but also relied heavily on code resources from the community and many talented hackers lending a helping hand along the way."

"A Very Super Mario World","","NTSC","United States of America","","","2017-05-21","1","No","Platform | Unofficial","Not Rated","Super Mario World has been around since my child hood. Super Mario Bros. 1 was my very first video game and I grew up on Super Mario Bros 3 and thought it was the best thing ever. I really don't remember when I first played Super Mario World but it wasn't until a long, long while after I played Super Mario Bros 3 (at that point I already had Super Mario All Stars) However, probably over a decade later after having played it, I'm still playing it, and still loving it. I don't think I'll ever outgrow classic Mario platforming. That's probably why I liked SMW hacks so much. I'd play a ton of them, even long after normal people likely would have gotten bored since a lot of hacks are still basically Super Mario World.

I've made no attempt to really set myself apart to that end, because when it comes down to it, that's what I'm here for; classic Mario platforming. Back during a time when we were actually excited to rescue the Princess again. Back during a time when we could separate levels by world and the levels told you what world they belonged to. Back during a time where there weren't any funky control gimmicks, weird goals or anything that distracted you from the overall feel that it was a Mario game, nothing more, nothing less. Just straight up run, jump, shoot fireballs, swing your cape, stomp on enemies and stuff like that. I've made this hack with that in mind, it's nothing but classic Mario platforming. Don't expect anything flashy, both on part of that and on part of my general inexperience and laziness in hacking.

There are eight primary worlds, an extra world, a star world that connects various places, and a special, secret world that will test your mettle (and patience.) The goal of every level is to reach the end, and possibly fight a boss such as a koopaling once you do. Many levels have secret exits that are usually opened by taking a key to a keyhole, as per usual Super Mario World fare. There's many features and gimmicks to many levels, but the feeling of classic Mario platforming typically stays the same. The story is always the same; Mario goes on an adventure to save his friends and the Princess from the evil King Bowser, and along the way jumps, shoots and even flies through the land in search of the castles controlled by Bowser's underlings."

It was ported to Nintendo Super Famicom in 1992.

In the year 2100, the Earth's environment is devastated by its inhabitants, who develop their space technology to live on Mars. Before they left, the humans created a Bio-Computer assigned to replenish Earth's ecosystem in hopes of returning to Earth. 50 years after terra-forming parts of Mars, the human colonists were attacked by mysterious, but hostile UFOs. The military leaders among the colonists set up an attack force to defend the colonists using state of the art fighter ships identified as the Icarus. The main operation of attack is called ""Acrobat Mission"" because it exceeds the technical flying ability of the pilots.
In the arcade version, surviving fighter pilots Jet and Nova are available for the player to choose for the rest of the game, but both were discluded from the Super Famicom port, making the player's pilot anonymous as well as discarding Nova's custom color scheme.
Here however is the story, exactly as it appears at the beginning of the game, with spelling and grammar mistakes preserved:
""AD 2100: HUMANS EXTERMINATED BY THEIR OWN NATURE DISTRUPTION AND ESCAPE TO MARS LEAVING BIO-COMPUTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL RECUPERATION OF EARTH. ONE DAY HALF A CENTURY AFTER HUMANS ARRIVED, MARS WAS ATTACKED BY STRANGE FLYING OBJECTES. TO FIGHT THESE ENEMIES, THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF THE DEFENCE AGENCY ORGANIZED THE TASK FORCE ARMY AND STARTED THE DOG FIGHT WITH INVADERS QUICLY. THE OPERATION WAS CALLED ""ACROBAT MISSION"" AS IT EXCEEDED THE PILOT'S TECHNICAL LIMIT.""

Players started the game equipped with the default weapon, the Standard Shot: a semi-automatic laser weapon. Though moderately powerful, the Standard Shot cannot be upgraded or charged. Once the player has lost a significant number of lives and their selected weapon his lost its upgrades, the Standard Shot will once again take over.
Two other weapons are selectable to the player, one of which is the Wave Shot (announced as Wide in the Arcade version). The Wave Shot is a spread shot that increases in size, numbers and strength. When charged, the Wave Shot can unleash a short range, but powerful laser blast that increases in width and strength when Wave icons are collected. The other weapon was the Hurricane Shot, a unique area-effect weapon that encircles the ship clockwise when fired before flying forward. When charged, the Hurricane Shot fires a ball of energy across the screen, but there is a one second delay every time the shot is fired.
The player also had Bombs although unlike many shooters, the player can only hold up to two bombs. Once collected however, the two bombs get physically mounted under the ship's wings. If an enemy shot hits one of the bombs, then the bomb will detonate, creating a destructive shield for the player. The player can manually detonate either bomb at will.
The player's Icarus fighter ship has a number of defenses at its disposal as well. Whenever the player moves their ship in any given direction, a burst of flame from the ship's jet exhaust will shoot out from the opposite direction the player moves the ship in. This applies to all directions: left, right, front, back and all four diagonal angles. This jet exhaust not only serves an aesthetic purpose, but it can also harm nearby enemies and destroy nearby objects.
Whenever the player is hit, their ship will steer wildly out of control. Once this happens, a timer will appear near the ship which indicates how long the ship has until it explodes. The explosion of the player's ship will harm any nearby enemies. Also, because the Icarus is apparently well built, any kamikaze enemies or drifting objects that touch it will not damage or destroy the player's ship, allowing the player less restrictive movement."

Aeron's Golden Cookie Quest is an old-school styled hack, that has inpiration in various video games including: Kirby, Mega Man, Castlevania, Ganbare Goemon, Shinobi, Mario and others. Instead of inspiring myself in any hack creator, I wanted to make this project as a love letter for videogames and I plan to achieve that with this hack.

It's a weird hybrid of traditional and chocolate. While this hack has a lot of ASM, its level design is more focused all in tackling obstacles than innovative level design. I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel or anything, just to be clear, so don't go with the wrong expectations, when playing this hack. Much like an old game, it has some bullshit moments, but a lot of good and rewarding gameplay.

This hack has lore, but it's not too wordy or too wacky. It's very easy to understand. Slightly inspired by The Second Reality Project 2 Reloaded."

There are no rival companies; the player controls the only one in the city and the game is resultingly fairly open-ended. A-Train III is the first game in the series to make use of near-isometric dimetric projection to present the city, similar to Maxis's SimCity 2000. There are two types of transport that the player's company can take: passengers or building materials. The former is more likely to be profitable, but building materials allow the city to grow. Wherever the building materials are delivered, they can be taken and used to construct buildings for the city. These start with houses, but eventually, as an area grows, roads, and shops and other buildings are built. These can provide extra revenue for a passenger service, but also allowing the city to develop and grow can be seen as a goal in itself. As well as the buildings built by the computer, in response to the materials being present, the player can construct their own buildings, such as ski resorts and hotels, and make profits from them if the conditions are right."

As with Chunsoft's Sound Novel series, it features a series of static photographs with Japanese text overlaid on top. The narrative is supported by background ambient music and sound effects.

The story was written by Japanese thriller author Jirou Akagawa, based on his novels Majotachi no Tasogare and Majotachi no Nagai Nemuri. It concerns an office worker who is prompted to look into the apparent suicide of a girl from his childhood after receiving a weird phone call asking for help and a vivid dream about her. He returns to the mysterious mountain shrine where she was reported to have burned to death.

The game was originally released for the Super Famicom in 1995 and later saw enhanced ports for the Sony PlayStation in 1999 (with the subtitle Fukkatsusai, or ""Easter"") and Windows PCs in 2001 (with the subtitle Kanzenban, or ""Perfect Edition"")."

It is the eighth entry in the Castlevania series, and the first of two Castlevania games released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System console. In Japan, the game is simply known as Akumajō Dracula - this title was chosen in order to signify a ""back to basics"" approach for the series.[1] The game was released in Japan on October 31, 1991, in North America on December 4, 1991, and in Europe on November 23, 1992.

The game has been re-released several times over the years. It was re-released on the Virtual Console in 2006 for the Wii, in 2013 for the Wii U, and in 2016 for the New Nintendo 3DS. In September 2017, it was included on Nintendo's Super NES Classic Edition in North America and Europe but was not part of the list in Japan. The game is also included in the cross-platform Castlevania Anniversary Collection, released on May 17, 2019.

As a result of the above mentioned ""back to basics"" approach, the game recycles the basic plot and protagonist of the original Castlevania released on the Nintendo Entertainment System: Count Dracula has awoken from a 100-year slumber and vampire hunter Simon Belmont sets out to seal him away once again. However, the game features entirely new levels and enemies, as well as an almost completely original soundtrack. Therefore, the game can be considered to be a wholly separate entry in the Castlevania franchise."

Go-kart racing involves regional action in the United States of America while snowmobiles provide challenge for the game's simulated winter months. Competing in the stock cars of the IROC is considered to be gaining experience for the faster and lighter open wheel vehicles of the Indy league."
