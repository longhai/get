"FIFA International Soccer","","PAL","United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland","Electronic Arts","Electronic Arts","1993-07-15","1","No","Sports","Not Rated","FIFA International Soccer is a 1993 sports video game developed by EA Canada's Extended Play Productions team and published by Electronic Arts. Based on the sport of association football, the game tasks the player with controlling a football team. The game was released for the Sega Mega Drive console in December 1993 and ported to numerous other systems in 1994.

The game was positively received on release; critics lauded the detail and animation of the footballers in the game, the crowd sound effects and the overall presentation. The speed the game ran at and issues with the response to the player's input were seen as the game's primary faults. The game sold well, served as a pack-in game for the Goldstar 3DO,[1] and led to a sequel, FIFA Soccer 95. It was the first game in the FIFA series."

"2020 Nen Super Baseball","Super Baseball 2020","NTSC-J","","Electronic Arts","NuFX","1994-03-03","2","No","Sports","Not Rated","Different from real baseball and other baseball video games, this game consists of both male and female characters, as well as robots. All three types of players have the same basic abilities and vary only on their personal strengths. In many cases, human players are better than their robot counterparts. One major difference between the human and robot characters is that the robot characters can blow up (or lose all their power) if they are worked too hard during a game. That can happen if you constantly make them dive for a ball, run extra bases, or even if they get hit by a pitch. Under no stress whatsoever, some robots, especially pitchers, will naturally run out of power as the game progresses. When this happens, they will lose all their abilities and be useless, both offensively and defensively. When that occurs, you can either power them up or replace them with another person on the roster. Human players do not blow up, but human pitchers can tire out. When they are tired, they will pant heavily and throw the ball very slowly. This can be remedied by either an upgrade or, as in real baseball, switching to a relief pitcher."

===============================================================================

The 240p test suite is a homebrew software suite for video game
consoles developed to help in the evaluation of upscalers, upscan
converters and line doublers.

It has tests designed with the processing of 240p signals in mind,
although when possible it includes other video modes and specific
tests for them.  These have been tested with video processors on
real hardware and a variety of displays, including CRTs and Arcade
monitors via RGB.

As a secondary target, the suite aims to provide tools for
calibrating colors, black and white levels for specific console
outputs and setups. 

This is free software, with full source code available under the GPL.

Sega Genesis/Mega Drive:
------------------------
It was developed using the SGDK, it was the first version
of the 240p Test Suite and is fully coded in C. In order to run it, we 
recommend a Mega Everdrive flash cartridge, or the older Tototek one. The 
Genesis resolution is 320x224 and is being used fully, in NTSC (60hz)."

The character has a variety of weapons and moves that the player must master to complete the game. Many gameplay ideas are borrowed from Treasure's earlier Mega Drive release, Gunstar Heroes. However, Alien Soldier puts an emphasis on challenging boss fights with short and easy levels serving as downtime in-between.

Development lasted two years and was led by Hideyuki Suganami, who from the start wanted to make the entire game himself. He chose the Mega Drive over more powerful 32-bit hardware because he was captivated by the system's strong reputation for ""action shooting"" games. Critics have praised the game's for its graphics, soundtrack, and overall intensity, recommending it for fans of Gunstar Heroes and the run and gun genre. Some negative critique was directed towards the hard difficulty, steep learning curve, and unorthodox gameplay. It was ported to the PlayStation 2 in Japan, and also re-released worldwide on Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console and Steam."

"Alien Storm","","NTSC-J","Japan","Sega","Sega","1991-06-28","2","Yes","Action | Fighting","E - Everyone","Alien Storm is a 1990 beat 'em up arcade game by Sega. It was later ported to the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive and Sega Master System. The Sega Genesis version was also released on the Wii Virtual Console in 2007. The game appeared in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

Alien Storm is a side-scrolling beat 'em up. The game resembles Golden Axe, with a similar artistic style, three playable characters (a man, a woman, and a novelty character) and pick-up or power-up special attacks. The player (one player only on the Master System version, up to two players on the Mega Drive version, three on the arcade version) selects from the three different characters to embark upon a quest to save the Earth from an alien invasion.

All of the Busters are playable from the beginning of the game. There are 6 missions to complete (8 in the Mega Drive version) with several stages, and each mission has the player blasting aliens, from the streets to the mother ship, where the mother of all aliens can be found. This task becomes increasingly difficult with each new mission, and the aliens are capable of hiding inside objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and other items. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people or destroying a UFO.

When dealing with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which can be shot to collect life or energy. Energy is used specifically to power the energy based attacks of the player's weapon (such as flames or electricity) and to use the much more powerful special weapons.

In a similar format as other early Sega arcade games, each character has unlimited usage of various short-range attacks, i.e. punches, kicks. Along with these standard attacks, each character has their own individual weapon (Garth's weapon that shoots lightning is replaced with a flame weapon in the Master System version). Special attacks are also included, and vary depending on the character chosen at the start of the game. For instance, Garth summons a U.S. Air Force starship that drops bombs across the street (in the Master System version he has Karen's special, a ballistic missile strike). Scooter will teleport out of his present location and leave a series of bombs that will blow up on the appearance of aliens, after which he will re-appear (in the Mega Drive version he just explodes, leaving his head, which his new body returns to retrieve). Karen calls down a nuclear missile, which incinerates every foe on the screen. However, a large amount of energy is depleted by using each character's special attack, and cannot be used if the energy of the player's character is too low.

There are few bosses in the game. The arcade original only features a single boss that has three distinct forms. The Mega Drive port has two of these forms as two separate bosses. At the end of each mission, the side-scrolling gameplay shifts to either a shooting gallery perspective where the player must take out the aliens that pop out of various locations, similar to the bonus stages of Shinobi and Shadow Dancer, both also by Sega, or a running section that is similar to the side scrolling mode but plays like a horizontal shooter instead with projectile weapons."

The Arrow Flash attacks can be charged by holding a button for several seconds, or collect icons during your flight to release it quickly afterwards.

"Art of Fighting","","PAL","","SNK","SNK","1992-09-24","1","No","Fighting","T - Teen","This fighting game began the story of the Sakazaki family and Robert Garcia. Yuri Sakazaki has been abducted by Mr. Big to punish her father, Takuma, and her brother, Ryo. To rescue her, Ryo and Robert must take on numerous enemies around South Town, eventually reaching the mysterious Mr. Karate. 

The passion of the game’s creators is evident in the unique game play elements introduced. These include an energy gauge that is depleted every time a fighter uses a special maneuver, Desperation Attacks that are usable only when a fighter’s health is low, and camera zooming that adjusts on the fly as fighters move around the stage. All these features ensure that players use strategy and tactics, rather than simply mash buttons. Adding to the mix are little touches such as characters showing cuts when they are injured and voice-over samples during cut scenes. 

Can you perfect the art of fighting and save Yuri?"

This fighting game is a coin-op conversion of the Neo-Geo hit of the same name, and has all characters, stages, and moves featured in the arcade unit. Unlike the original arcade version, players can now play as Mr. Big and the elusive Mr. Karate.

The gameplay differs from most fighting games. In this game, you have a Spirit meter. A Spirit meter is in the game and will decrease as you perform special moves. It can be recharged, but doing so leaves you open to attack. When your health is almost gone, you can perform a secret combination that will unleash a deadly attack on your opponent - provided you have a full Spirit meter."

A year has passed since the events of Streets of Rage. To celebrate the defeat of the mysterious 'Mr. X' and his syndicate the previous year, Adam Hunter, Axel Stone and Blaze Fielding met at their favorite nightspot in the city and spent their time reminiscing about their vigilante crusade against ""Mr. X"" and his organization. Axel and Blaze had moved out of the city after the adventure from last year. Axel has begun working as a part-time bodyguard and Blaze teaches dance classes. Adam has since rejoined the police force and lives in a small house with his younger brother.

The next morning, Axel received a phone call from Eddie 'Skate' Hunter, Adam's younger brother. Skate had arrived at home from school and was shocked to find his house in ruin and his older brother missing. Attached to the front door was a picture of Adam chained to a wall at the feet of Mr. X. The criminals began to retake the streets once more. Beatings and lootings took place regularly and in broad daylight. Chaos reigned in the city, far worse than before.

Realizing that Mr. X and his syndicate has returned for revenge against them and the city, Axel and Skate waste no time in telling Blaze about the unexpected situation and Blaze herself is determined to help Axel out in defeating Mr. X and rescuing Adam. Accompanied by Adam's young brother Skate and Axel's ""friend,"" a professional wrestler named Max Thunder, Axel and Blaze set forth on a rescue mission, which will take them from the city all the way to Mr. X's hideout on a desolate island, where they will eventually face Mr. X and his bodyguard Shiva.

Iron Fist Scriptures?) in pre-release media and the official soundtrack release, is a side-scrolling beat 'em up released by Sega in 1994 for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. It is the last part of the Streets of Rage series. It was later released for the Japanese version of Sonic Gems Collection for the Nintendo GameCube and PlayStation 2, and for the Wii Virtual Console on September 24, 2007. The game also appeared in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

The game had featured several enhancements over Streets of Rage and Streets of Rage 2 such as a more complex plot, multiple endings, longer levels, increased difficulty, more in-depth scenarios (with interactive levels and the return of traps like pits) and faster gameplay (with dash and dodge moves). Weapons could now only be used for a few times before breaking and could now be integrated with unique moves with certain characters, hidden characters were added and a few cutscenes were included to give the story greater depth.
The game is more fast-paced than its predecessors. Running and vertical-dodge moves were added (only Skate could run in Streets of Rage 2), and most player attacks deal less damage than in the predecessors. The level timer has been replaced with a ""power meter"" that, when full, allows players to perform special moves without draining the player's life bar.

Unlike the first and second game, weapons in Street of Rage 3 can only be used a fixed number of times. However, additional weapon special attacks could be performed. The game also features return of SOR1 team attacks in which two characters work together to perform a powerful attack as in the first game. Blitz moves, performed while players run, were altered so that they can be upgraded in strength over the course of the game. The player would have to earn a set amount of points on one life to upgrade it. Losing a life would put the blitz move down a level, but the upgraded moves could still be performed by pressing X on a 6 button controller, followed by a button sequence.

Traps in stages were brought back from the original game, for example, enemies can once again be thrown into pits or off the side of an elevator.

Enemy AI was expanded so more enemies can pick up weapons, block attacks, employ co-operative attacks (usually, a Big Ben-like enemy will throw one of the Garcia enemies at the character to smack them down), and even steal exposed food items to regain health.

The Japanese version of the game also brought back of riding a Motorcycle, which was removed from the Western release of the game."

Now being a fan of Telenet you’d think I’d side with Battle Monsters being the better monster battler. Sadly not. Telenet’s Riot team have produced one hell of a steaming pile of crap. In fact you can tell right away that this game is going to be a dud as soon as you pass the title screen. No options or decent game modes to choose from. Basically you get Player VS CPU or Player VS Player. That’s it.

In game graphics are average at best although there is quite a bit of sprite flicker at times when two beasts line up against each other. Not really acceptable in a game when you only have 2 moving characters on screen. Mind you, the audio is far worse than the graphics. Awful tunes with what I think are a few grunts from the beasts. The samples are that low in quality that I can hardly tell.

But wait, maybe this game looks and sounds so bad because it plays so well? Afraid not. Beast Warriors plays just how it looks and sounds, awful. The controls are ropey, collision detection is a mystery at times and the AI of the CPU seems to pull off moves that just wouldn’t be possible. There’s no question about it. The best aspect of Beast Warriors is the cover art which to be fair is very nice. If you’re the kind of person who buys games for their cover art then I’d say this would be on top of your shopping list but for the rest of us this game should be flushed down the toilet with the rest of the shit."

The game consists of ten single, fixed screen levels. Each level contains a birthday cake with candles on it. To win a level a boy or a girl, chosen at the start of the game, needs to blow out all candles. The cake often has multiple layers (platforms) that can be reached by jumping. Sometimes there is also jelly that can be used to jump and reach a high area. Some levels contain small floating flames that need to be avoided. These flames can also reignite some of the candles. The candles are put out by blowing, with a button press, and this can also be used to push the floating flames back. This later Genesis version has upgraded music, more challenging enemies, and the character can now drop directly from a layer of birthday cake."

The game is the sequel to Lakers versus Celtics. The game's name refers to the previous season's NBA championship series, the 1991 NBA Finals matchup between the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers. It is the second game in the NBA Playoffs series of games.

Although there is no SNES version for Bulls vs Lakers, the SNES (and first) version of Bulls vs. Blazers was heavily based on Bulls vs Lakers, with the later Mega Drive version introducing a few changes from this.

Bulls vs Lakers introduced a television broadcast-style presentation with a fictional television network, ""EASN"", the Electronic Arts Sports Network. It was the first team basketball game to feature an in-game instant replay feature. Bing Gordon, the Chief Creative Officer of Electronic Arts, was featured as the game announcer. This was also the first game to depict NBA team logos on the courts.

Gameplay[edit]
The game can be played in various ways: players could play against each other, or against the computer. Games against the computer were divided into two modes, ""Exhibition"" or ""Playoffs"". Players could pick from one of the 16 teams that competed in the 1991 NBA Playoffs. Rosters featured many top NBA stars of the time, including Michael Jordan. Games could be configured for 2, 5, 8 or 12 minute quarters. New to the series is a star underneath the player to let users easily know which player they are controlling.

The game takes place inside a tall, rectangular playing area, as in Tetris. Columns of three different symbols (such as differently-colored jewels) appear, one at a time, at the top of the well and fall to the bottom, landing either on the floor or on top of previously-fallen ""Columns"".

While a column is falling, the player can move it left and right, and can also cycle the positions of the symbols within it.

If, after a column has fallen, there are three or more of the same symbols connected in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, those symbols disappear. The pile of columns then settles under gravity. If this causes three or more other symbols to become aligned, they also disappear and the pile settles again. This process repeats as many times as necessary. It is not uncommon for this to happen three or four times in a row - it often happens by accident when the well is becoming crowded. If the well fills beyond the top of the screen, the game ends.

Occasionally, a special column called the Magic Jewel appears. The Magic Jewel flashes with different colors and when it lands, it destroys all the jewels with the same color as the one underneath it.

Like Tetris, the columns fall at a faster rate as the player progresses. The goal of the game is to play for as long as possible before the well fills up with symbols.

Some ports of the game offer alternate game modes as well. ""Flash columns"" involves mining their way through a set number of lines to get to a flashing jewel at the bottom. ""Doubles"" allows two players work together in the same well. ""Time trial"" involves racking up as many points as possible within the time limit."

Outside of Japan, the port was released under the name Two Crude Dudes.

In the game, players control one of two mercenaries hired by the U.S. government to stop the terrorist organization ""Big Valley"". Their objective is to retake control of a ruined New York City from Big Valley after a nuclear explosion the group caused.

Players control the Crude Busters by jumping, dodging and attacking their way through legions of enemies. Because the main characters are muscle-bound brawlers, they have the ability to pick up objects well beyond their own weight (e.g. cars and traffic lights) to use as weapons.[2] They can do the same to most enemies as well. While playing co-op, it is also possible for one player to pick up the other to use as a projectile.

Each player has a life bar, which decreases each time they're hit. Some enemies can grab onto the players and drain their life. A player loses a life when his life bar reaches zero. If the hit that finishes a player is an explosion or flame, he slumps to the ground burnt. The life bar is fully refilled between stages, with a cut scene showing the player(s) punching a ""Power Cola"" vending machine causing sodas to fall out which they drink."

The story

Long ago in the Kingdom of Asteborg, a war broke out, pitting humans and demons against each other in a bloody battle. Sagramor, a powerful mercenary, and Maria, a sorceress with fighting magic, joined forces to defeat the demonic army.
Sagramor found a way to lock the demons in an alternate dimension, at the cost of his own life. His sacrifice earned him the title of ""Legend of Asteborg"".

Shortly before the end of the war, Maria gave birth to a child named Gareth.
She died 4 years later.

Gareth was then taken in by the royal orphanage, and Bohort, the leader of the armed troops, saw in him an invaluable potential. He trained him from an early age to become a formidable warrior.

Decades later, Zadimus, the former leader of the Demons, who survived the great war, found a way to reopen the portal to the parallel dimension in order to free his fellow Demons and declare war on the humans in order to take back the Kingdom of Asteborg.

As Gareth, now the royal guard of Asteborg, you will go on an adventure, braving the lands of the kingdom and its dangerous lands populated by bloodthirsty monsters.

Along the way, you'll learn more and more about the ancient war and your identity.
But beware, Zadimus won't let you get away with it..."

"DJ Boy","DJボーイ","NTSC-J","","Kaneko \ Sammy","Kaneko","1992-05-01","2","Yes","Fighting","Not Rated","DJ Boy (DJボーイ) is a 1989 beat 'em up arcade game developed by Kaneko. It was published in Japan by Kaneko and in North America by Sammy.

DJ Boy, also known as DJ Kid, was designed as a standard side-scrolling beat'em up game partially based on the hip-hop culture of the U.S. cities. What made the game unique at the time was the fact that many of the characters rode around on roller skates rather than walking or running.

The premise of the home console game: A young man named Donald J. Boy (DJ Boy) is a roller fighter taking part of an ultimate fight-race known as ""Rollergame"", taking place in Cigaretch City, located on the outskirts of New York City. Many people were excited to see DJ Boy, but a roller fighter gang known as the Dark Knights want him out of the competition. Their leader, Heavy-Met Tony, calls his gang to kidnap his girlfriend Maria, who also comes into town and defeat DJ Boy. DJ Boy must rescue Maria, defeat the Dark Knights, and win the Rollergame competition in one adventure. The arcade plot tells a different story. Two rollerskaters named Bob & Tom (the two playable characters) were breakdancing to the beat of their boombox, until it got stolen from rollerskater thieves (possibly the Dark Knights), in which they must find and defeat them in order to retrieve what is rightfully theirs.

DJ Boy skates across various stages and utilizes hand-to-hand combat moves in order to defeat opponents, culminating with a battle with a boss at the end of each level. Along the path, the player also encounters prizes, which then can be used later to purchase Power-ups from a store located at the end of each level (in the home version, the arcade simply tallied these as points). In the console versions of the game, as another game, River City Ransom, the ""prizes"" consist of coins that are dropped by defeated enemies, or food items like burgers that restore health."

DJ Boy is able to punch, kick, combine them in a flying attack and punch to both sides at the same time by pressing the main attack buttons. Although the visuals are less rough and friendlier than its contemporary counterparts, the difficulty is very unforgiving. DJ Boy has only four life bars and when they are gone, the game is over without continues. Defeated enemies leave behind coins. At the end of each stage the coins can be exchanged for a skateboard, a stronger punch or other items."
"Doctor Robotnik's Plan B","Dr. Robotnik's Plan B","Region Not Set","","","Team Painto","","1","No","","","Doctor Robotnik's Plan B is my hack focused on new boss fights. This one is the same exact version as the last release except one small bug, due to focus on Scorched Quest.

Features:
* 7 new boss fights - the zones consist only of these, as nobody feels like playing S1 over again wit just new bosses. The bosses are using (mostly) original zone boss weapon in more or less direct way, except for SBZ, which originally didn't had a boss.
Besides from the main point, I added small little features:
* Normal and Time Attack mode - added these after suggestion from my Team, so the game has a bit more replay value. In Normal mode you get 5 lives, while in Time Attack you have infinite amount of these. The progress isn't saved so if you get a Game Over, you need to play it again (Normal mode only, as TA doesn't have Game Overs).
* Best Times menu, where you can check the best times in each boss. Times are saved only when playing on Time Attack mode or from Level Select. After beating the TA mode fully you will also see the Times from current run until you return to Main Menu.
* I've changed a bit the ending - it's accessible by either beating the game or selectable on the Main Menu (it's selectable after beating the game once). (Sonic 1 cheat works too)
* Level select, which allows you to play a selected boss in TA mode. Goes back to SEGA screen after results card (this differs between modes). Like Ending, selectable after beating the game once. (for contest purposes, Sonic 1 cheat works too)
* Title screen is edited.

Also available is a limited number of lightning bombs that damage or destroy all enemies on screen.

Defeated enemies often drop power-ups, including hearts that replenish health, lightning bombs, bonus points, 1-UPs, options and experience points.

Options are small ""drones"" that fly alongside the player's ship and mimic its behaviour.

A and C shoot; you can hold them down for rapidfire. Shooting destroys blockades and enemies. Once all the M bags are gathered, find the exit to move on to the next level. In between each level, you must answer a bunch of questions related to the story of the Bible of the game's theme; getting them wrong appears to be inconsequential to the outcome of the game (this needs investigation)."

The goal of the game is to push the frontline to the enemy headquarters, by winning individual battles and then beat them in their own capital.

There are five kinds of soldiers, each with their weapon of choice and range of attack: the Gunner (machine gun, medium range and wide arc), Launcher (rocket launcher, long range), Chucker (grenades that can be thrown over barricades), Scorcher (flame-thrower, close combat) and Blaster (dynamite sticks, close range). Before each battle, players can choose the composition of their team from one out of four choices: Assault team, Brute Force, Commandos (a team of just two soldiers which have different controls) and Demolition.

Gameplay is simple to learn, with the A button being used to fire at the nearest enemy, B to move to a the pointer location and C to cycle through soldiers. Using the commando team changes the controls, with the directional pad controlling a soldier directly, with B being used to call the other soldier nearby. While basic commands are simple, the player must deal with things such as distance from target and angle of attack to succeed. If two opposing soldiers face-off during battle, they engage in a brawl (indicated by a cloud of dust). When that happens, the battle stops and the players are in direct control of the soldiers: A punches, B kicks and C blocks. Every downed soldier can can be rescued if there are enough medics available, earned at the end of each battle depending on how well the player did. 

Up to four players can play, cooperatively or against each other."

A Super Nintendo port was also in development but was never completed for undisclosed reasons, though a prototype exists on the Internet. The game is loosely based on the McDonald's fast food chain and has a strong environmentalist message.

A Game Boy port of the title was also fully developed (by Damian Stones, of Climax) but was never released for the same legal reasons as the Super Nintendo port.

In the single-player game, the player controls Mick or Mack through four worlds; Slime World, Mystical Forest, Toxi-town and Arctic World. Each world has several sub-stages where the character must collect a certain number of Golden Arches to advance.

They are guided in their quest by Ronald McDonald, who appears at the beginning and the end of the game. The characters are armed with a Super Soaker-type gun that shoots gooey projectiles.

The game engine is the same used in other Virgin Interactive games such as Cool Spot and Disney's Aladdin, as all of them (Mega Drive/Genesis versions) were handled by David Perry's programming team, which eventually turned into Shiny Entertainment."

Also new is the concept of an in-game announcer, whose comments occur continuously in real time in accordance with the action (as opposed to the previous method of only having voice samples after plays (or in the case of other sports, hits, goals, etc.)), similar to how American football is broadcast on television.

While the concept of in-game commentary would become a standard across most forms of video game American football (and sports gamsein general), Joe Montana II stands as one of the first to bring this feature to home consoles.

Based on the sport of American football, the game puts the player in control of a football team in modes such as tournament play and sudden death. It was officially endorsed by John Madden.

The game's Sega Genesis version was developed by Blue Sky Productions, which was simultaneously creating Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss. John Madden Football '93 adds new animations and features, and it allows players to play as and against famous teams such as the Oakland Raiders of 1976. Aside from Madden Football 64, the game was the last in the Madden franchise to lack the NFL license, which was featured in Madden NFL '94 onward.

With over one million units in sales, John Madden Football '93 was a commercial success.

On one side, the spectacular dunks of Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls; on the other, Larry Bird's incredible accuracy from the outside. 

While Bird feels right home at the three-point contest, where five racks with five balls each are placed around the three-point arc and the player must pick each ball and throw in the the best timing possible to get as many points as possible during the 60 second window, only Jordan has the air-time to perform on the slam dunk contest, where the player has a number of dunks at his disposal, each requiring different timing to get the best score from all three attempts from the judges, and win the competition.

While they are two completely different players, they can still go one-on-one on a half-court match, played to points or with a time duration. Can Bird's stealing and outside shooting ability be a match to Jordan's speed and jumping abilities?"
"Joshua & The Battle of Jericho","","Region Not Set","","Wisdom Tree, Inc.","Wisdom Tree, Inc","1992-01-01","1","No","Puzzle","Not Rated","Crystal Mines is a 1989 unlicensed puzzle game for the NES by Color Dreams. When they established Wisdom Tree, they repackaged the game twice: in 1991 as Exodus: Journey to the Promised Land and in 1992 as Joshua & The Battle of Jericho, with Joshua labeled a sequel to Exodus. These two versions would be remade for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993 and 1994, respectively.
Though the games do have a TMSS check, they will only do the $A14000 write if they detect the region of the console they are running on as US — therefore, the games will only boot on either any US Mega Drive or on any other Model 1 Mega Drive without TMSS (making that a partly useless form of region lockout).

Gameplay of both versions is identical: you are the main character (Moses or Joshua, respectively) and you must collect all the bags with M on them (Joshua: coins with $ on them) scattered throughout each maze. A and C shoot; you can hold them down for rapidfire. Shooting destroys blockades and enemies. Once all the M bags are gathered, find the exit to move on to the next level. In between each level, you must answer a bunch of questions related to the story of the Bible of the game's theme; getting them wrong appears to be inconsequential to the outcome of the game (this needs investigation)."

Upgrading from the 8-bit NES to the 16-bit SEGA Mega Drive brought changes to the classic titles with updated sprites and stages, remastered music, and gameplay tweaks. Additionally, Retro-Bit's programmers were able to improve some slowdown issues from the original version. Those who are able to complete all three titles on a single save file would be able to enter the Wily Tower - four new bonus stages. Along with new Robot Masters to face, this also allowed players to customize their weapon loadout to deal with the Genesis and Dr. Wily once and for all!

"Mega-Lo-Mania","Tyrants: Fight Through Time","PAL","","Virgin Interactive Entertainment (Europe) Ltd.","Sensible Software","1991-05-17","1","No","Strategy","Not Rated","First you choose one out of four different characters to represent you, Scarlet (red army), Oberon (yellow army), Caesar (green army), or Madcap (blue army). The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which can be completed in any order, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its own surprises.

Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles.

Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.

Later on higher levels, you'll also build mines and factories, as you'll need to dig a certain material for higher level weapons, depending on whether the area you're on is rich with a certain material or not. With each next level, you'll start from a higher technology level and be able to progress to one higher level up than at the previous level.

If there is more than just one enemy, you can make an alliance until you crush the other one - three of you can form an alliance against fourth enemy. For what its worth, a certain numeric level of defence is always stronger from the same level of attacker, and men that are not armed (conscripts) can only kill enemy soldiers, not destroy or attack enemy fort.

The main thing as always in strategy games is to be the sole survivor and lead your men to victory, experimenting on vicious technologies, equipping your men, making perfect soldiers out of them, produce shields, weapons, planes... to dominate the world and crush your opponents.

You can do the battling only in a certain quadrant, but don't be long as your men will automatically start building the fort, and it will be at the bottom of age level and you'll need to invent everything for that one again."

The story involves a young girl named Asha, who, upon hearing spirits whisper on the wind pleading for help, embarks on a journey to find and help them. Along the way she becomes the master of a genie and adopts a small flying creature known as Pepelogoo.

Expanding upon previous games in the series, Asha has the ability to swing her sword upward, downward, and forward while in midair, depending on which direction is pressed. She can also use her shield while standing by holding down.

Asha can summon her pet Pepelogoo to reach areas that she cannot on her own. By holding onto him, she can slow the descent of her jump (via his flying ability) or even perform a double-jump. Pepelogoo can also protect Asha from falling rocks, be used as a platform over lava geysers, and blow out fires that obstruct Asha's progress.

Equipment upgrades are purchased in the hub town. Armor increases Asha's pink life heart meter. Shields increase her defense and give her stat resistances to certain elements, such as fire or ice. Swords increase Asha's attack stats with critical effects depending on the sword.

Some items cannot be purchased and must be found in the temples and caverns that Asha must explore. Healing medicine will restore Asha's health or bring her back to life if she has Pepelogoo. Gold bars can be traded with the rich lady in town for in-game currency. And finally, there are 150 life drops hidden throughout the game. Collecting ten will add a blue life heart to the life meter.

Items can be permanently missed. Once an area's boss is defeated, that area is inaccessible for the rest of the game."

A key feature of NBA Jam was the exaggerated nature of the play - players jumped many times above their own height, making slam dunks that defied both human capabilities and the laws of physics. There were no fouls, free throws, or violations except goaltending and 24 second violations. This meant the player was able to freely shove or elbow his opponent out of the way. Additionally, the game had an ""on fire"" feature, where if one player made three baskets in a row, he would become ""on fire"" and have unlimited turbo, no goaltending, and increased shooting ability, until the other team scored (or the player had scored four consecutive baskets while ""on fire"")."

It was released on October 31, 1996 and was the successor to NHL 96. It is the sixth installment of the NHL series and the first to be released on both PlayStation and Saturn.


NHL 97 took the graphics even further ahead, using a full 3D engine, with motion captured polygonal players (PC/PlayStation/Saturn versions only, the Mega Drive and SNES versions retained similar graphical values to previous games, but with further enhanced animations). Each goaltender has his own custom-painted mask and the original artwork can be seen inside the game with a special ""Goalie Mask Viewer"". NHL 97 also introduces play-by-play commentary, provided by well-known announcer Jim Hughson.

For the first time since EA Hockey, national teams were added, but only Canada, the United States, and Russia have their own teams while the other two are selections of the best European players. NHL 97 introduced a skills competition, allowing the user to pick players to compete in drills such as hardest shot, goalie 2 on 0, and accuracy shooting, among others.

This was the first year of the ""Third Jersey."" Teams that had available third jerseys for NHL 97 were, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Boston Bruins, Los Angeles Kings, Pittsburgh Penguins & Vancouver Canucks. These were the first teams to try out the third jersey. To activate the alternate uniform left click on the teams banner in the controller setup.

In addition, each team in the game had one player with a special skill. Examples are Joe Sakic's (Colorado Avalanche) ""wrong-footed wrist shot"" and Rob Ray's (Buffalo Sabres) ability to check an opposing player while still controlling the puck. A major flaw in the game was the glitch that allowed players to score 100% of the time when shooting down by taking a shot against the boards at the hash marks of the left circle in the bottom zone.

Along with the PC, Mega Drive/Genesis and SNES versions, both the Sega Saturn and PlayStation version made their debut, although they were rushed and buggy. For instance, the shot speed in the PlayStation and Saturn versions was so slow that some skaters could beat a slapshot down the ice.

Pac-Man himself walks around in a cartoon world and interacts directly with the player, as well as with objects and other characters. The player cannot control Pac-Man directly, but instead can direct his attention in various directions, and is armed with a slingshot that can be used to strike certain objects, including Pac-Man himself.
Pac-Man's mood varies throughout the game, usually in response to his environment or the player's actions, and generally his mood affects his actions and his willingness to cooperate with the player; the varieties of ""bad"" moods can at time compromise the player's ability to progress. There are a few instances, however, where Pac Man is required to be angry. Hitting objects with the slingshot can often get Pac-Man to look at that object and piece together parts of the puzzle he is currently trying to solve - for example, hitting a door may cause Pac-Man to go inside a house to discover a clue. But beware - a few objects when hit can also produce disastrous (and humorous) results. Hitting a trash can on a city street at the wrong time, for example, can cause a cat to jump out and attack Pac-Man.
Throughout the game, Pac-Man is occasionally harassed by the four ghosts from the classic Pac-Man games. When this happens, Pac-Man is paralyzed by fear and eventually faints, unless the player gives him a power pellet. Then Pac-Man becomes Super Pac-Man for a brief time and flies around, eating the ghosts. In some cases, the ghosts may leave behind important objects."

In 1998, EA began publishing their golf games with the endorsement of Tiger Woods. After Tiger Woods 99 PGA Tour Golf was released, subsequent titles were named Tiger Woods PGA Tour and released yearly.

Although EA Sports developed most games in the series internally, some SKUs have come from outside developers including the first edition, Tiger Woods 99 PGA Tour Golf, which Adrenalin Entertainment developed in conjunction with EA for the PlayStation and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2001 for the PlayStation, which was developed by Stormfront Studios. IOMO also produced versions of the game for mobile phones for the 2002, 2004, and 2005 editions.

In October 2013, EA announced that it would end its relationship with Woods, and be replaced by a new golfer on the next instalment. On March 16, 2015, it was announced that Rory McIlroy—the current top golfer in the world, would become the new title athlete of the franchise, which will now be known as Rory McIlroy PGA Tour.[1][2]

The series was responsible for several innovations in the genre, such as the now standard three-click swing method, and in 1995 a critic stated in GamePro that ""The PGA series flies high above the rest for two reasons: You can completely control a shot, and you play on the best courses around.""[3] However, unlike other games in the EA Sports label, the series was often shadowed by other competitors such as the Jack Nicklaus series, Links series, Microsoft Golf or The Golf Pro"

Phantasy Star III is a sequel to the previous game in the series, Phantasy Star II, although the connections to other games in the Phantasy Star series are not immediately evident. Gameplay is similar to the games before it in the series, with combat still being turn-based and battles randomly occurring. Players must explore both overworld maps and dungeons in order to progress through the game.

Phantasy Star III mostly follows the traditional roleplaying game formula seen throughout the series, with exploration of several 2-D worlds, character recruitment, and random enemy encounters using a turn-based battle system. Unlike previous games, the series staple of ""techniques"" play a diminished role in combat, which is ironic considering the role they play in differentiating the game's two major factions - with techniques being exclusive to Layans, and viewed as ""evil magic"" by the Orakians."

Gameplay is open-ended; the player may choose to attack enemy ships or towns, hunt pirates, seek buried treasure, rescue long-lost family members, or even avoid violence altogether and seek to increase his wealth through trade. The game also has no predetermined end, although as time goes on, it becomes more difficult to recruit crew members. Also, as the player character ages, fighting becomes more difficult, and deteriorating health will eventually force the character into retirement. The game ends when the player retires, at which point he is given a position in his future life, from beggar to King's adviser, based on accumulated wealth, land, rank, marital status, and other accomplishments."

As many as three people can play at a time, but there will be extra opponents to fight during any of this game's 15 different matches.

Every third fight is known as a Grudge Match. In a Grudge Match, the player must fight against a CPU controlled clone of his or her fighter (if playing alone) or the other players in a multiplayer game. Each player has three ""knockdowns"" - getting knocked down three times eliminates them from the Grudge Match, the winner is the last man standing. This match plays more like a bonus round, in that there is only results are gaining or failing to gain bonus money, and losing the Grudge Match does not eliminate a player.
The final battle, the ""Championship Match"", is between the player and the mysterious entity that taunts between matches every once in a while, the Masked Warrior. If more than one person is playing the game before this match, they must fight each other to the death until only one becomes victorious and can fight him.

The player must jump, punch, and kick their opponent until his/her energy runs out. If the player presses all three of the buttons at a time, the character will perform a ""super move"".
Sometimes during matches the player will come across foreign objects such as knives, crates, sticks, motorcycles, and bar stools that can be thrown at you or your opponent. The player may also come across a power-up known as the ""power pill"". If the player or the opponent grab this item, one will become temporarily stronger and take less damage from hits.
Sometimes even the crowd will interfere in the fights. Two characters, known as Knife Man and Knife Woman, will come out of the crowd and stab the player with their daggers. The player can take these nuisances out with one hit. Sometimes there is also a fat bearded man with a stick. If the player knocks him down, the player can take the stick and use it against the current opponent.

The audience will also push any fighter that ends up among them, and stays there more than a few seconds. They will be forced back into the fighting area."

"Road Rash 3","Road Rash 3: Tour De Force","NTSC","United States of America","Electronic Arts","Monkey Do Productions","1995-03-01","2","No","Action | Racing","E - Everyone","Following the previous two Road Rash games, the player has conquered the US illegal motorcycle championship. But why settle for that when one can take over the World; racing in the peaceful streets of the UK, dodging the animals in Kenya, blaze through the night in Japan or jump in the hilly circuits in Italy?

Keeping the same spirit of the previous two games, Road Rash 3 adds all new digitized sprites (based on Sega-CD remake released an year earlier), bike upgrades, more weapons and meaner police. Most other aspects of the game remain unchanged: the player starts on the lowest division with a small amount of cash and a slow, hard to handle bike. To get more money (and get a faster bike) the player must beat as many of the other 15 racers to the finish line, using all means possible, even kicking and punching them into knockout. By clearing (finishing on the top three spots) all five races on a level, the player advances to the next, where opponents are faster and tougher, the police is more active and a longer race.

As for new gameplay elements in the final title in the series released for Sega's 16-bit console, bikes can also be improved by choosing cheaper upgrades (instead of simply buying new ones) such as tires (less skidding), engine (improves acceleration and top speed), suspension (allows better control while landing after jumps) and body (bike takes more hits before turning into smoking metal). Instead on relying on simple motorbike patrols, the police now has helicopters at their disposal (which try to land on the player) and patrol cars, which attempt to block the path of the bike, forcing it to stop or collide to get a bust. To make things easier (or harder), new weapons were added, some of which allow the carrier to stun an opponent for a few seconds, making him the perfect victim for an incoming vehicle. Also new, if the player finishes the race with a weapon, carries it to the next race.

Each track has its own features: in the UK, cars drive left on a rainy day, in Australia and Kenya animals wander into the road, in Brazil bikers can get themselves a close-encounter with a car on a crossing, in Italy the hills allow a lot of air-time for light and speedy bikes, Germany, where the icy roads and sharp turns make a deadly combination and finally in Japan the race goes during the night under the neon lights."

"Shining Force II","","PAL","United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland","Sega","Sonic! Software Planning","1994-07-02","1","No","Role-Playing | Strategy","E - Everyone","Shining Force II is a tactical role-playing game. The player assumes the role of the Shining Force leader, Bowie. When not in combat, the player can explore towns and other locales, talk with people, and set the members and equipment of the army. Some towns have a headquarters where the player can inspect and talk with his allies. While roaming through town or moving throughout the world, one can find both visible and hidden treasures and interact with certain objects.
Each ally unit is represented by a character with a background and personality. Some of these characters are hidden, requiring specific events to occur before they will join the force. Each ally unit also has a class, which defines the abilities for that unit. These abilities range from what type of weapons they can use to what kind of spells they can learn. Units can become stronger by fighting enemies and performing various actions which gives them experience points (EXP), which allow them to gain levels. Once a unit reaches level 20, that character has the ability to advance to more powerful class through promotion. Some characters have two different classes they may be promoted to, one of which is only accessible using a special hidden item.
Battles take place on a square grid, and each unit occupies a single square. Battle is turn-based. Each turn, a character can move and perform one action: either attack, cast a spell, or use an item. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping an item during the turn, do not count as actions.
The battle is won if all enemies are defeated, or if the enemy commander is defeated. If Bowie is defeated in combat or withdraws, the battle is lost and the player is returned to the nearest town, where he can recover his allies and fight the same battle again."

Dialogue in the game has been vastly reworked - about 40% of all text passages have been altered, replacing the oftentimes bland writing of the original.
Most of the not so appealing graphics in vanilla SF2 have been improved/replaced, such as the battle sprites of the Vicars or the Archers.
Difficulty has been reworked by tweaking enemies’ stats, skills and numbers on the battlefield. Battles will usually appear familiar, but will often play out quite differently thanks to new abilities, magic spells and some surprises.
Party members have been rebalanced greatly, as to make all characters useful in their respective roles; e.g. Kiwi is now a useful companion, Peter is no longer the one-man-army from before, Karna is no longer strictly superior to Sarah.
Gameplay-wise, the hack will require you to play more tactical; careful positioning and a well-thought-out composition of your party are more important than in the original game."

The game's music was composed by Motokazu Shinoda, a professional Japanese concert pianist and composer (sound programmer Noriyuki Iwadare is often miscredited as co-composer)

Soleil is a village in a large continent overrun by monsters, and the crusaders of Soleil are sent out by the King to save the humans. While on your own quest, you save an old lady who tells you to talk to a fortuneteller west of Soleil, who exchanges your ability to talk to humans with the ability to talk to animals (for the first half of the game, that is). Now, you must rely on your sword and the aid of a group of animals to rid the world of monsters — though along the way, you'll come to realize monsters aren't as evil as the humans make them out to be."

This cart, determined to be near exact to the one shown in two 1992 episodes of Nick Arcade, predates the more famous Simon Wai prototype. It was found and sold to drx in cartridge form for $1500 via a community effort.

In this version, only one zone can be normally played: Emerald Hill Zone. The rest of the Zones can be played only through a Level Select code. The level select screen is completely identical to the Japanese version of Sonic 1, and even contains the original Green Hill Zone, which is somewhat unplayable because of strange physics (caused by differences in how collision data is handled between Sonic 1 and Sonic 2)."

Like the original, players run through different worlds called ""zones"", which each have their own specific theme. There are two Acts in nearly all of the 10 Zones, and at the end of each Zone's last Act is a machine that Robotnik controls, which you must defeat to progress. The evil Dr. Robotnik wants to conquer the world. In order to do that, he imprisons and transforms all animals into robots called ""Badniks"". This way they can build his powerful weapon, the Death Egg. Only Sonic the Hedgehog, and his new tagalong partner, Miles 'Tails' Prower, can stop Robotnik and his army of Badniks from taking over the world. 

Sonic and Tails can collect rings which are scattered throughout all of the levels. As with most platformers, when the player collects 100 rings, they earn an extra life. However, the rings also act as protection; if Sonic is hurt when he is carrying rings, they scatter everywhere and he is briefly invincible. If he is hit again when he has no rings, he'll lose a life. If the player reaches a continue point lamppost with 50 or more rings, they'll be able to access the Special Stage. In this stage, you must gather a set amount of rings in a halfpipe-like stage before you reach a checkpoint. Complete all the checkpoints and you'll earn one of the seven Chaos Emeralds.

New to Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is the ability to play the game co-op with a friend - at any time, a player can plug in a second controller and take over the AI controlled Tails. Tails has infinite lives and the camera remains focused on Sonic, meaning that Tails will not hinder play. Sonic (and Tails) can now also get speed from a standing start by holding down and repeatedly pressing the jump button for a ""spin dash"". This is useful when stuck near steep slopes or other areas where you need some momentum. The game also features a 2-player versus mode. This mode is a horizontally split-screen race through levels based on three of the zones in the single player game."

With Knuckles tricked and trying to stop the heroes at every turn, will they be able to stop Robotnik in time?

Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is the third in the Sonic series of games. As with the previous games, it is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed. The basic game remains the same - players collect rings to earn extra lives, which are also used for protection, and scatter everywhere when Sonic is hurt. Sonic can jump on enemies to defeat them, and Spin Dash by holding down and the jump button, then letting go of down.

New to Sonic 3 are three different types of shields - the Fire Shield (which protects you from fire but disappears if you enter water), the Water Shield (which lets you breathe underwater infinitely) and the Electric Shield (which pulls nearby rings towards you). Sonic can use extra abilities when he has these shields by pressing jump while in the air - either a horizontal fireball dash, a vertical bubble bounce, or an electric double jump. If Sonic has no shield active, he can activate a brief energy shield, also by pressing jump in the air. Tails cannot use the shields' special abilities, but he can instead either fly or dog paddle (in water) for a limited time. He can also carry Sonic with him while doing so.

There are now two types of bonus stages - one is available by collecting 50 or more rings, running past a checkpoint lamppost and then jumping into the stars (as you could in Sonic the Hedgehog 2. This stage give you the chance to earn bonus rings, lives and power-ups. In this stage, there is a giant gumball machine. By hitting the crank, you'll spit out a bonus item that can either be rings, lives or bonus shields. The stage is over when you fall down the bottom of the screen.

In these stages, you must collect all the blue spheres while avoiding the red ones (which end the stage early).

Once you collect all the blue spheres in the stage, it clears and you earn one of the seven Chaos Emeralds.

Sonic 3 features six different Zones, which are made up of two Acts. At the end of each Act is a boss that must be defeated to complete the stage and rescue Sonic's animal friends that Robotnik has captured to turn into Badnik robots.

As with Sonic 2, there is a two-player Vs. Mode, which plays in a split-screen horizontal style. There are special monitor pick-ups in this mode which do things like swap player positions, lose rings, or cause a Badnik to appear. You can also race against the clock in a time trial mode."

Robotnik needs them to repair the Death Egg, so he tells the guardian of Floating Island, Knuckles the Echidna, that Sonic and Tails are there to steal them. With Knuckles tricked and trying to stop the heroes at every turn, will they be able to stop Robotnik in time?

Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is the third in the Sonic series of games. As with the previous games, it is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed. The basic game remains the same - players collect rings to earn extra lives, which are also used for protection, and scatter everywhere when Sonic is hurt. Sonic can jump on enemies to defeat them, and Spin Dash by holding down and the jump button, then letting go of down.

New to Sonic 3 are three different types of shields - the Fire Shield (which protects you from fire but disappears if you enter water), the Water Shield (which lets you breathe underwater infinitely) and the Electric Shield (which pulls nearby rings towards you). Sonic can use extra abilities when he has these shields by pressing jump while in the air - either a horizontal fireball dash, a vertical bubble bounce, or an electric double jump. If Sonic has no shield active, he can activate a brief energy shield, also by pressing jump in the air. Tails cannot use the shields' special abilities, but he can instead either fly or dog paddle (in water) for a limited time. He can also carry Sonic with him while doing so.

There are now two types of bonus stages - one is available by collecting 50 or more rings, running past a checkpoint lamppost and then jumping into the stars (as you could in Sonic the Hedgehog 2. This stage give you the chance to earn bonus rings, lives and power-ups. In this stage, there is a giant gumball machine. By hitting the crank, you'll spit out a bonus item that can either be rings, lives or bonus shields. The stage is over when you fall down the bottom of the screen.

"Sonic the Hedgehog Megamix","","Other","","Team Megamix","?","2008-08-13","2","No","Platform | Unofficial","Not Rated","South Island. A magnificent land; one that is not bound by restrictions such as time.

15 years have passed since Sonic the Hedgehog's first plight against the nefarious Dr. Eggman (originally known as Dr. Ivo Robotnik in English localisations). Ever since, the two sides have clashed nonstop in a variety of settings, with the eventual outcome always being Sonic's victory. Both sides have gained both new allies and new enemies; some helpful, others... not so much. Naturally, throughout this time, Sonic has learned a few new techniques, which he uses to further stifle Eggman's plans of world domination. And so, the world is safe - but always just out of Eggman's grasp.

Some say history repeats itself. In this case, the statement is proven true, as Eggman returns to South Island, in hopes that he can obtain the land's powerful Chaos Emeralds, and finally put forth a solid step in conquering the planet. As he arrives on the island, he brings with him a single Chaos Emerald - one that had been missing, and had upset the natural balance of the island for decades beforehand. The others were trapped in an alternate dimension; one which only very few could enter, and from which even fewer returned.

Of course, Eggman isn't very good at keeping his plans secret (a big reason why they're foiled so easily). As a result, Sonic hears of this, and readies his travel back to South Island. With him, he brings two allies: one being Mighty the Armadillo, a longtime friend of his (though they had not spoken in quite some time); and the other being Shadow the Hedgehog who, after finally getting over his angst (at least for the moment), felt like teaching Eggman a thing or two about trying the same thing twice. And besides that, he had never seen South Island before; he had heard things about it, certainly, but never saw it for himself. So, he figured, why not?

And so, the three begin their trek of South Island, each taking their own unique abilities with them, and going their separate ways, each in search of the remaining Chaos Emeralds, and of Eggman, in hopes that once he is defeated, he will finally abandon his plans of world domination. But, then again, that's not very likely to happen.

We can all dream, I suppose."

"" Sega produced their home version of Strider for the Mega Drive/Genesis, which was released in Japan on September 29, 1990, with subsequent releases in North America and the PAL region. It was advertised as one of the first 8-Megabit cartridges for the system, and went on to be a bestseller. This version was also re-released for the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on November 15, 2011 and later in North America on February 16, 2012. The Genesis/Mega Drive version contains a different ending from the arcade game. This ending shows the destruction of the final stage as the game's protagonist makes good his escape. This is then followed by the main credit sequence that sees Hiryu flying his glider in space and reminiscing about the various encounters he had during his mission as he heads back to earth. The ending theme was an edited combination of two separate pieces of music planned for the arcade game, but replaced with a repeat of the first level music.

Han Solo and Chewbacca are racing to the Kashyyyk planet to celebrate the Life Day with their family and friends. Unfortunatelly, Imperial Forces intercepted the Millenium Falcon and captured they on the detention block. Leia and C3PO received a help message from they and contacted Luke Skywalker.
You are Luke Skywalker and your mission is to save Han and Chewie from the evil Imperial Forces to finally celebrate the Life Day.

This game was made in only 20 days and started as a joke: How ""The Star Wars Holiday Special"" would be adapted as a ""Super Star Wars game"" , what would be the differences on the plot and how cool would be to make a game in only 20 days to be released at the Christmas holidays!? It could be much more for sure, but i think for a retro game made in so small time during my free time after job, i think its actually a solid result. LOL"
"Super Street Fighter II","Street Fighter II","PAL","","Capcom","Capcom","1993-09-10","2","No","Fighting","Not Rated","This remake of Street Fighter II featured a new scoring system that kept track of combos, first attacks, and reversals. Additionally, four new characters join the returning twelve characters from the original. Super Street Fighter II is also the first game in the SFII series to give full move sets to the boss characters. Previously in Street Fighter II: Champion Edition and Street Fighter II: Turbo, whilst the four boss characters were available, they did not have different animations for some punches and kicks. Although this was expected for Balrog (being a boxer), it was unusual to see a character doing a punch when pressing a kick button, or vice-versa.

Aside from the bosses' added moves, some of the main characters' moves were adjusted in some ways. For example, the differences between Ken and Ryu became more defined - Ryu focusing on deadlier fireballs, and Ken's fierce Dragon Punch being able to set opponents on fire."

The game features eight fighters: the four turtles, Casey Jones, April O'Neil, Ray Fillet (from the comics) and the original character Sisphyus.

The gameplay is similar to other games in this genre: each character has standard attacks (normal and strong) as well as special attacks which require button combinations to perform. The goal is to deplete the other fighter's life energy completely. However, a losing opponent has one last straw: a very powerful attack which is only unlocked shortly before death. The amount of rounds can be set between one and seven.

The game's modes include a story mode, in which the selected hero has to battle against Krang's evil clones of the player characters in order to save the kidnapped Splinter, a two-player mode, a practice mode and a tournament mode which requires the player to fight against multiple opponents one after another with only one life bar."

Sega bizarrely also released versions on Taito's B-System and H-System arcade boards in Japan.

Sega attempted to port the game to the Sega Mega Drive, however sales were blocked by Nintendo who owned the home console rights to the franchise (they had taken Atari's home console division, Tengen to court over a similar incident on the NES). As such, only about 10 cartridges were produced, all of which were only released in Japan. This version is now a rare collector's item, being sold in auctions for up to US$16000.

This grim holocaust was caused in the first place by the super defence mainframe Skynet, an artificially intelligent system which thought the easiest way to protect the planet was to wipe out the entire human race and replace them with robots. 

Thus a nuclear war was initiated which killed billions, and machines everywhere declared war on the survivors - even people's Megadrives and electric toothbrushes turned against them. Luckily for us humans the man John Connor was on hand to lead the human race to victory. In a last ditch attempt to ensure victory, Skynet decided to send a super-hard Terminator cyborg back in time to kill John's mother, Sarah, thus preventing the lad from ever being born! John got wind of this insidious plot, however, and sent one of his crack soldiers back to protect his mummy. 

In this long-awaited game of the film you play the part of Kyle Reese - hard person extraordinaire. It is your job to destroy that nasty Terminator and thereby save Sarah Connor from a sticky end. There are four levels of platform-based shoot 'em up thrills, each one loosely based on a scene from the movie - including the climactic showdown in an empty machine shop.

However, many of the stages now stretch beyond the height of a TV screen, which allow the player more space to maneuver and dodge incoming fire (but also makes it easier to miss power-ups). Also, the player now has the option choosing the play order of the first four stages, instead of just the starting stage like in Thunder Force III.

The weapon system is similar to Thunder Force III. Featuring the same upgradeable defaults, and unique extra weapons that are either exclusive, or were in previous games. Again, upon ship destruction, the weapon currently being used is lost, apart from the defaults. The CRAWs return, and basically have exactly the same function as their Thunder Force III counterparts. The speed setting also returns, although it is represented by a percent gauge from 25 (lowest speed) to 100 (highest speed).

The most significant addition to the ship arsenal is the Thunder Sword, a very powerful lightning-based frontal attack. At the game's halfway point, the ship receives an add-on part which enables the use of the Thunder Sword. From here, the one requirement of using the Thunder Sword is that the ship be equipped with CRAWs. When the ship is not firing any weapons, a charging noise is heard (followed by a chime when fully charged) and the CRAWs will appear to be surrounded with electricity. The next press of the fire button will discharge the Thunder Sword. The blast is stronger if charged longer and is at its strongest when fully charged."

One of the earliest examples of a weapon-based fighting game after the launch of Street Fighter II, Time Killers takes eight fictional warriors from different time periods (both past and future) and pits them in a battle royale to gain immortality.

Released around the same time as the original Mortal Kombat, the game is known for its optional excessive violence as fighters could have their arms sliced off (and still fight) and can become decapitated through special ""death moves"", prematurely ending the round. It's also known for having the attack buttons corresponding to specific limbs (a mechanic later used in the Tekken series).

It is one of the few action-oriented arcade games from Incredible Technologies (who went on to make sports-oriented arcade games, primarily the Golden Tee Golf series). After the game's release, they would soon develop the game's spiritual sequel: BloodStorm.

The Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis were intended to receive ports of the game by THQ subsidiary Black Pearl at late 1993, but were shelved. The Sega Genesis version would later receive a release in July 1996 as part of THQ's ""Arcade Classics"" series."
"Time Killers","","PAL","","Strata","Incredible Technologies, Inc.","1992-11-10","2","No","Fighting","Not Rated","Time Killers plays much like Mortal Kombat, with some similarities to Street Fighter II. Rather than the standard layout of punches and kicks of various strengths, a specific button is used to attack with the corresponding body part: left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg, and the head. A stronger attack can be executed by pressing both limb buttons at the same time. The attack buttons involving respective arms and legs are also the basis of BloodStorm as well as Namco Bandai's Tekken series, the 2011 Mortal Kombat game, and Bio F.R.E.A.K.S..

If enough damage is done to an arm, it will be severed from the character's body, rendering it useless in combat. A character can lose both arms in the same round, forcing them to fight with only legs and head and depriving them of the ability to block. Damage can also be done to the legs, but they cannot be severed.

The player may attempt a ""Death Move"" by pressing all five buttons at once. If successful, the attack cuts off the opponent's head and ends the round immediately; however, it can be blocked. A ""Super Death Move"" is also possible, but can only be executed while near a stunned opponent; the player holds the joystick toward the opponent and presses all five buttons, cutting off both arms and the head. Both of these moves differ from the ""Fatalities"" in Mortal Kombat in that they may be attempted at any time, rather than after winning two out of three rounds. Severed limbs and heads are restored after each round."

Some years later, development documents were acquired and a prototype ROM was released to the general public in July 2013. [1]

It is not known why the Mega Drive version of the game was cancelled - a Super Nintendo version was released in North America and Europe in early 1994, suggesting the Mega Drive version was originally set to be released around this period. Malibu would be sold to GameTek in the coming months which may explain its disappearance. A different Time Trax was released for the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum in 1986.

It is considered to be the spiritual successor to Slap Fight. Based around a video game within a video game concept, players assume the role of a young secret agent assigned by the government taking control of the NA-00 space fighter craft in an attempt to defeat the titular virtual reality simulator, rescue the abducted players who lost against it and unveil its true purpose.

Headed by DonPachi producer Kenichi Takano, Grind Stormer was created by a small development team of new employees at Toaplan who would later go on to work at one of its offshoots after the company declared bankruptcy in 1994 and was originally titled Bakuretsu Wing before being ultimately renamed to V・V in Japan. It is notable for marking the debut of Cave co-founder Tsuneki Ikeda in the video game industry, serving as one of its programmers and features a much smaller hitbox for the ship compared with previous shoot 'em up games released at the time. It is also notable for being one of the last games by Toaplan to feature an FM soundtrack, as the company began to clear out their FM chip inventory. Initially launched for the arcades, the game was later ported to the Sega Genesis by Tengen and first published in Japan on 25 March 1994 and a month later in North America, featuring both the original Japanese and North American versions as selectable gameplay modes.

Grind Stormer proved to be popular in arcades but the game has been met with mixed reception from critics and reviewers alike since its release on the Genesis, who felt divided in regards to several aspects such as the presentation, visuals, sound design and gameplay. It has been regarded by some to be an early example of a manic shooter. As of 2019, its rights are owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in 2017 by former Toaplan member Masahiro Yuge and now-affiliate of Japanese arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia alongside many other Toaplan IPs."

The game begins in the Weapon X lab, and continues through the icy landscape of Dead Man's Land, the Canadian forests and a hallucinatory lunar scenery. In New York, Wolverine must make his way through the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club, an underground dungeon, and the NYC sewers for a final showdown. Lots of enemies stand in his way: flying robot drones, armed guards, The Hand ninjas and Inner Circle bodyguards, among others. He can take them out with basic jumps, kicks and slashes, as well as link the basic moves into more powerful combos. When Wolverine takes damage, his mutant healing factor kicks in, (slowly) regenerating his health. Health packs should be sought out, however, because just sitting around waiting for the health to recharge is not an option: a timer slowly ticks down to the appearance of the android girl Elsie Dee, designed to destroy Wolverine. Her embrace means instant death.

Besides the basic enemies, many levels also includes a number of boss fights, some against faceless hardware like a giant robot or a helicopter, others against Wolverine's signature foes. These include classics like Sabretooth and Lady Deathstrike as well as many culled from early 1990s X-Men comics like Albert (an android replica of Wolverine), Cyber, Trevor Fitzroy and Shinobi Shaw.

The game balances basic concepts found in both platformers and arcade shooters. The player is able to jump and shoot projectiles from a sword. He must ride a flying dragon and confront a large boss throughout the second half of each round. The player's life bar steadily diminishes as time passes. Health is gained through collection of fruit and projectile weapons. Some fruits, when shot, will expand and burst into multiple items.

In the action scenes, the player's vitality decreases as he makes his way towards the skull, but this can be restored by collecting fruit. A wide variety of weapons can be picked up, and not only do these allow the player to use the weapons for a limited amount of time, but they also increase vitality. In the shooter scenes, the player rides a pink friend as he makes his way through the scene. Here, vitality remains static unless hit by an enemy passing by. As usual, there is a boss waiting at the end that must be defeated. Every boss changes color to show how much damage has been done to it. Some bosses must be defeated in two stages.

Game time may be customised from as short as a minute per half to the full regular 45 minutes. A coin toss is determined by the 'home' team and play will commence. Depending on the options set before the match, the gamer may opt to have less dribble control (resulting in the game ball sliding in the direction of the player movement); manual goalkeeper control which puts the player in control of all goalkeeper saves and kicks; ball-trapping, of which the player will not be able to shield the ball and allows opponents to snatch it away without necessitating a tackle; and no pass-back rule which was implemented during World Cup '94 where a keeper may not pick up the ball whenever an outfield player passes it back to him.
If the gamer opts for manual goalkeeper control, the player would have to make a save by guessing where the opponent will place the ball and jumping into the general direction with any of the console buttons and the directional keys if applicable. Similarly, outfield players have the option to either pass the ball, kick it (when attempting to score a goal) or attempt a lob. Freekicks may also be executed using any of the above. However, a penalty kick is done in a different game screen similar to that of World Cup 98 (video game) and where a hovering indicator swings from side to side to indicate the direction of the shot.
Basic tactics (or preset tactics) can also be customised prior to the game and may be changed in-game.

Use shotguns, Bazokas, Homing Missiles and Banana Bombs in your bid for survival and the ultimate accolade.... Victory!

Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.

Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends.

There's a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and girders.

There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be formed."

However, what makes the game unique is the ability to use a traction beam to trap an enemy and then throw him against his peers, destroying them.

The game (more precisely, the European PAL version of it) is known for being the origin of the grammatically incorrect phrase in the English translation, All your base are belong to us, which has since become an internet phenomenon."

In 2101, the Milky Way Federation made peace with the space pirates led by the cyborg CATS as they looked to expand further into the galaxy with strategic defense bases. Barely a few years passed before the space pirates were back again with CATS breaking his word and simultaneously attacking the bases before they had a chance to defend themselves.

Aboard the 1011 Star Cruiser, a bomb explodes and rips through the Federation’s flagship destroying the mothership and all the ships on board - all but one. The last ZIG space fighter is able to take off before the ship completely explodes.

Take control of the avenging ZIG space fighter across 8 stages using 3 different weapon types and your trusty Tractor Beam to fling objects back into the enemy. Take out each of the enemy’s commanders including the flamboyant CATS and reclaim all your bases.
