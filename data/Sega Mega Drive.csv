"Clue","","Region Not Set","","","","","","No","","","Up to six players can play, using any controller. The object of the game, as in the board game, is to find out who killed Mr. Boddy where and with what.

Each player is dealt a number of cards. All the cards held eliminate the suspect, weapon, or room on the card. Each player can view their own cards during their turn. A die is rolled, and the six players (represented by the six suspects Miss Scarlet, Col. Mustard, Mrs. White, Mr. Green, Mrs. Peacock, and Prof. Plum(Know as Prof. Fart[citation needed] in Brazil)) move around the board. Upon entering one of the nine rooms on the board, the player must make a suggestion, choosing a suspect and a weapon (the room the player is in is automatically chosen.) A vignette is shown, showing who or what was in that room, or who held the weapon. This would result in a clue given, such as ""Miss Scarlet was in the Lounge"" or ""No one had the wrench."" On the highest difficulty, the clues given are less broad, like in the board game, with clues only given that the chosen suspect or weapon was or wasn't in the room. The suspect chosen in the suggestion is moved to that room.

A player can, on their turn, make an interrogation, wherein they can choose a suspect, a weapon, and a room. A longer vignette is shown, playing out the scenario as the player chose. Example: ""The lounge was warm. It was cozy enough for a nap... A long nap. Miss Scarlet laughed as she fixed her hair. She picked up the pipe."" At this point, one of the other players, if they are in possession of a card that eliminates any of those factors, shows on screen that they have proof that the scenario could not have happened. If none of the other players are in possession of such a card, the interrogating player is not proved wrong. Players may make two interrogations per game.

A player can, on their turn, make an accusation, which plays out similar to an interrogation, unless if the player is incorrect, they are eliminated from the game. If they are correct, the actual suspect is seen killing Mr. Boddy in an addition to the vignette and is then seen being arrested. The accusing player is the winner."

The dispute can only be settled through a warranted duel with the Federation’s one duelist to fight against the collective nine alien duelists representing the nine Galactic Federations in control of the space traffic ways, otherwise known as The Super 9’s. The player assumes the role of Barrett Jade, a mecha pilot to win back the space ways and duel against the nine other duelists.

Players started the game off with their first duel with a set number of ammunition for their weapons; the player’s robot had a total of three weapons indicated by all three buttons on the controller. Once the player completed the duel, they would go through a type of Bonus Stage that would qualify them for the next duel as well as increase their score and money. Players could then purchase more ammunition or even new weapons for their robot at a local shop. Players had to time their attacks and aim precisely for key locations of their opponents body. Some enemies could regenerate missing parts of their body (including their head) while some enemies depended on particular mechanical parts to evade fire. If the player ran out of ammunition for all their weapons before the duel was over, they would lose a life and restart the duel over (with the same amount of ammunition they started the duel with). If the duel timer ran out before the duel was over, the player would also lose a life and restart the duel."

Development began in 1988. Atari also originally intended to release the game in 1988. However, according to one of Atari's Engineer and designer, it was delayed due to the dispute from its Vice President claiming that no one would buy an arcade cabinet for $10,000 after The Last Starfighter arcade game was canceled for the same reason a few years ago earlier. After weeks of research, it was decided that $10,000 was an acceptable price point.[5] [6] [7]

Hard Drivin '​ was released in February 1989,[1][3][8] when arcade driving games were largely implemented with scaled 2D sprites, such as Pole Position and OutRun, and when filled-polygon 3D graphics of any kind were rare in games. Hard Drivin '​ is the second commercially released arcade racing game to use 3D polygons, after Winning Run.

"Hua Mu Lan: Mulan","","Region Not Set","","","","2000-01-01","1","No","Action | Platform","Not Rated","Hua Mu Lan: Mulan is an unlicensed action game by some unknown developer for the Sega Mega Drive made some unknown year. It is based on either the Chinese legend of Hua Mulan or the 1998 Disney film of the same name — which it steals art from, giving us a potential earliest release date. Some of its music is stolen from another unlicensed game, Chuanpu's 1996 Ya Se Chuan Shuo; whether or not the rest is also stolen has yet to be determined.

Interestingly enough, the game has a story screen... in Chinese, English, Spanish, Portugese, and Arabic. The stories appear to be identical: during the Tang Dynasty, the Hun warlord Tan-Yu led his soldiers to seize the dynasty, and Tang conscripts all men to fight the oncoming forces. Hua Mulan, not wanting to see her old father fight, goes in to fight for him.

The game is a typical platformer. B attacks and C jumps."

Race driver Mario Andretti personally guided the development of the AI used by the non-player drivers in stock cars, Indy style open wheel racing, and dirt track racing.

The game's greatest innovation was the presence of different physics and AI for three kinds of racing in one cartridge.

The success of Mario Andretti Racing led Orr and Hilleman to work with Stormfront to launch the highly successful NASCAR Racing series, which continues as one of the best-selling franchises in the EA Sports lineup today.

Another game starring Andretti, called Andretti Racing, was released for the Sega Saturn, PlayStation in 1996, and for PC in 1997."

"Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures","","Region Not Set","","Namco","Namco","1994-08-26","1","No","Action | Adventure","E - Everyone","In Pac-Man 2, the player plays the role of an observer and assistant that follows Pac-Man as he sets out to accomplish various tasks. Pac-Man himself walks around in a cartoon world and interacts directly with the player, as well as with objects and other characters. The player cannot control Pac-Man directly, but instead can direct his attention in various directions, and is armed with a slingshot that can be used to strike certain objects, including Pac-Man himself.
Pac-Man's mood varies throughout the game, usually in response to his environment or the player's actions, and generally his mood affects his actions and his willingness to cooperate with the player; the varieties of ""bad"" moods can at time compromise the player's ability to progress. There are a few instances, however, where Pac Man is required to be angry. Hitting objects with the slingshot can often get Pac-Man to look at that object and piece together parts of the puzzle he is currently trying to solve - for example, hitting a door may cause Pac-Man to go inside a house to discover a clue. But beware - a few objects when hit can also produce disastrous (and humorous) results. Hitting a trash can on a city street at the wrong time, for example, can cause a cat to jump out and attack Pac-Man.
Throughout the game, Pac-Man is occasionally harassed by the four ghosts from the classic Pac-Man games. When this happens, Pac-Man is paralyzed by fear and eventually faints, unless the player gives him a power pellet. Then Pac-Man becomes Super Pac-Man for a brief time and flies around, eating the ghosts. In some cases, the ghosts may leave behind important objects."

Knuckles' jump was modified so that it reached the same height as Sonic would reach in Sonic the Hedgehog 2, but his mid-air mobility was slowed to give the gimped feeling his jumps had in Sonic & Knuckles.

Laut der Legende sollen die Chaos Emeralds von dort stammen und nachdem Tails ein Radargerät zur Erfassung von Chaos Emerald-Energie gebaut hat, nimmt dieses tatsächlich noch andere Energie neben den in Sonics Besitz befindlichen sieben Chaos Emeralds wahr.

Mit dem Doppeldecker-Flugzeug namens Tornado folgen Sonic und Tails dem Signal und entdecken tatsächlich die Insel Angel Island aus der Legende, über dem Meer in Wolken verhüllt schwebend.

Sonic und Tails erkunden die Insel, erkennen jedoch schnell, dass Dr. Robotnik auch hier die heimischen Tiere in Roboter und Kapseln eingesperrt hat. Es stellt sich heraus, dass Angel Island den Absturz des Death Egg in der Tat abfederte und Dr. Robotnik seit dem Absturz damit beschäftigt ist, das Death Egg hier wieder zu reparieren.

This game will make use of that audio chip but it can also be played with the console's original audio if desired.

The player will control 3 different characters at the same time (the player can control any of the 3 characters at any time and the other characters will be controlled by the CPU). The player can give orders and priorities to the other characters at any time so the companions do what we need them to do.

The gameplay is deep, with some strategy and tactics, character development at will (grow a given character as a tank or as an attacker or healer, etc.). The story also begins simple and quite typical, but it will evolve and change quite a lot. The decisions you make during the game will have consequences.

The game should take around 20 to 30 hours to finish (depending on the player) and it has re-playability value since your choices will slightly change some parts of the story and ending."
