Snowland, who lost the princess who controls the magic of snow, begins to melt little by little. At this rate, the kingdom will soon disappear! Nick and Tom, the snowmen, felt unprecedented resentment at being robbed of the princesses in front of them. They vowed to rescue the princesses from the hands of the villains, and set out for the kingdom of Hotda, where the enemy was waiting.

The home of the enemy, Hotda Castle, is a 70-store stone tower. A fire-breathing monster is roaming, and Atchich is worried about the fire and built the castle out of stone. It's more like a fortress than a castle because it's durable first, so it's not a very elegant castle. The snowmen, who are not good at hot places, tried to infiltrate the hot castle of Atchich with courage.","https://thegamesdb.net/game.php?id=109954","2025-11-04T02:50:14.013Z",""

Players start out as a high school team. Games consist of two halves. One touchdown must be scored before time runs out in each half or the game is lost. After a touchdown is scored, the half ends and the 2nd half of the game starts. If the player scores in both halves, they win the game and then move on to the next level of difficulty. Difficulty levels after high school go from college, pro, then to super. The higher the difficulty, the less amount of time is given for a player to score a touchdown.

Since the game is concerned with scoring touchdowns, in the 1 player game the player is always on offense. Players can score points for completing passes and for gaining yards by either rushing or passing. Scoring a touchdown also adds to the player's score, as does any remaining time on the clock after the touchdown is scored. Also after a touchdown, the player can add on to their score by kicking an extra point.

Other rules on the field include getting a 1st down to add time to the clock. If the player throws an interception or goes four downs without getting a 1st down, they are penalized yards.

In a 2 player game, the second player plays defense until it's their turn to play offense.","https://thegamesdb.net/game.php?id=89224","2025-11-04T02:50:27.406Z",""

Obudowa na początku była w przyjaznym dla oka kolorze fioletowym, później pojawiały się reedycje kartridża, różniących się kolorem i kształtem obudowy a z czasem także pojawiła się podróbka ''168 in 1'' do której dodano parę innych gier. Na labelu były miniaturki okładek wybranych gier, które między innymi znajdowały się na karcie. Nad obrazkami widniał napis ''168 in 1'' a obok napis ''high quality'' o czym wspomniałem wcześniej, producenci kartridża zapewniali nas o wysokiej jakości już na labelu a także go reklamowali grą Contra, która była pożądana w tamtych czasach i była najbardziej popularną grą zaraz obok Super Mario Bros (napis Contra widniał na labelu a także po uruchomieniu konsoli ze 168 in 1 witało nas duże logo CONTRA z Bóg wie czemu przygrywającą muzyczką z gry Booby Kids, niemniej bardzo ona pasowała i nie drażniła uszu). Kartridż miał także label z tyłu obudowy, na którym widniał mikroskopijnym drukiem cały spis gier jakie zawierała składanka; później takie labele pojawiały się na innych składankach, które zawierały kilkadziesiąt gier i więcej, był to niewątpliwie wielki plus dla graczy gdyż mogli sprawdzić jakie gry zawierają składanki bez kupowania ich w ciemno.","https://thegamesdb.net/game.php?id=122557","2025-11-04T02:50:43.232Z",""

Size-optimized ports of Artemio's 240p Test Suite to 8-bit consoles

I've remade Artemio Urbina's 240p Test Suite for three more platforms:

    Nintendo Entertainment System
    Game Boy and Game Boy Color (as ""144p Test Suite"")
    Game Boy Advance (as ""160p Test Suite"")

The NES and GB ports are in assembly language for speed and size efficiency. The GBA port is in C, but still size-optimized to fit well within the 256 KiB multiboot limit.

The GB and GBA ports have a different name because their LCD video timing doesn't match that of NTSC. They exist to test not only the TV but also the Super Game Boy or Game Boy Player accessory, which behaves as a scaler.

Some functionality has been rearranged to fit the controller or to combine the function of similar tests. Some help pages have been rewritten for completeness, conciseness, and English usage improvements. Some tests' graphics have been replaced to keep the software free.

To get set up to build the NES port, install GNU Make, Coreutils, Python 3, Pillow, and cc65 per nrom-template instructions. The port to Game Boy uses RGBDS instead of cc65. The GBA port uses devkitARM and libgba by devkitPro, but Python 3 and Pillow are still required to convert the proportional font.

Like Artemio's original versions, these ports of 240p Test Suite are free software under the GNU General Public License, version 2 or later.

So, I went about putting the basic elements of those games into one cart, but just more standard (for instance, just regular Tic-Tac-Toe), and for 1 or 2 players. With that said, there is some sort of glitching that happens to the PPU during Tic-Tac-Toe that I could never track down, but ah well. It was a neat project.

"75993","3D Block","","Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","Region Not Set","","","Hwang Shinwei","1989-01-01","1","No","Puzzle","Not Rated","3D Block is a pirated port of Blockout, made for the Famicom by Hwang Shinwei in 1989. There are three versions: a 1989 version credited to Hwang Shinwei and a 1990 version credited to ""RCM Group"" with a slightly different title screen. A 1991 version exists on some multicarts and credits both.

This is an adaptation of Blockout, which in itself is a 3D version of Tetris. This is emphasized with the cartridge itself, having the artwork ripped from the original game. In this version the well is 5x5x10 cubes large and the size never changes, unlike the official versions. The controls are somewhat unorthodox, as unlike most other games, the Select button pauses the game while Start speeds up the block so that it moves to the bottom of the well faster. The block designs themselves are the same as in the arcade version of Blockout.

There are 20 levels in total, with the player being able to start on any of the first 9, and the speed of the game can be set like in Tetris. Normally, you can select only the first 10 levels, but by pressing A, B, Up, then Down on Controller 1, then pressing A to increase the level number counter, you can select levels 11-20 as well. The levels increase in speed as they progress and on most of the levels there are blocks which are in full 3D as opposed to standard Tetris blocks. On each level, 4 layers have to be cleared to advance. Clearing all of the blocks on the screen automatically ends the level. After completing level 20, the game reverts back to the title screen where the shape in the middle changes color to reveal a nude, poorly digitized woman wearing high heels. This same effect can be found by pressing A, B, Up, then Down on Controller 1, then pressing Select 10 times on the title screen.

The graphics are mostly taken from Blockout, apart from the title screen and menu, which are original. When the blocks are stacked up in this version, they appear to be layers of squares. The music, however, is the same music heard in Hwang Shinwei's other games.","https://thegamesdb.net/game.php?id=75993","2025-11-04T02:51:42.833Z",""
