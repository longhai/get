"10-Yard Fight","","Region Not Set","","","","1983-01-01","2","No","Sports","","The game is viewed in a top-down perspective and is vertical scrolling. The player does not select plays for either offense or defense. On offense, the player simply receives the ball upon the snap and either attempt to run with the quarterback, toss the ball to a running back, or throw the ball to the one long distance receiver - basically the option offense. On defense, the player chooses one of two players to control, and the computer manipulates the others. The ball can also be punted or a field goal can be attempted.
10-Yard Fight has five levels of difficulty; from easiest to most difficult: high school, college, professional, playoff, and Super Bowl. If the player wins both halves of an ""accelerated real time"" 30-minute half at an easier level, the player advanced to the next level of difficulty, like a career mode."

1943: The Battle of Midway is the sequel to the 1984 arcade video game, 1942.

The game is set in the Pacific theater of World War II, off the coast of the Midway Atoll with the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces as the main group of antagonists. The player takes the role of an unnamed U.S. Navy ace pilot seeking revenge to defeat the Japanese naval aerial forces that attacked the American aircraft carrier, destroy all Japanese air and sea forces, fly through the 16 stages of play, and ultimately destroy the battleship Yamato, the game's final boss. 11 of these stages consist of an air-to-sea battle with a battleship or an aircraft carrier as the stage boss, while 5 stages consist of an all-aerial battle, either against a squadron of multiple strategic bombers or a single heavy bomber, the latter requires the player to shoot its engines to destroy it.

As in 1942, players pilot a P-38 Lightning. Controls are also similar: button 1 fires main weapons, and button 2 performs two special actions: one of three special lightning attacks in exchange for some of the player's fuel, or a loop maneuver like in 1942 if buttons 1 and 2 are pressed simultaneously. Indeed, players now have only one life, in the form of a large ""fuel"" meter; constantly depleting, but refillable by collecting various powerups. In 2-player mode, when both players overlap their planes on screen, the energy bar can be transferred from the player with more fuel to the player with less. Destroying a complete formation of red enemy planes will result in a power-up, such as a health boost or a new main weapon.

There are cheat codes, different for every stage, ranging from holding down a fire button or pointing the joystick in a certain direction; player(s) are rewarded with fully upgraded weapons."

The next day, Allen notices an advertisement in the classifieds with similar sentence structure to the letter left by the kidnappers. Rick couldn't understand it so easily, until Allen told him to look cautiously at both, the letter and the ad. They soon realised that the writing was actually a secret code, only understood by certain crime lords, so Rick and Allen struggled toward the main base of the Legacy organisation to find the truth and save the kidnapped daughter.

"Acrobatic Dog-Fight","","Region Not Set","","Technos Japan Corp.","Technos","1984-01-01","2","No","Shooter","","Acrobatic Dog-Fight was released in 1984, but would be considered new and fresh even if it was released today. The basic goal of each level is to get to the end, but the way you get there is anything but a straight line. Your plane (which can go in any direction, pulling off loop-de-loops and such at will) has a constantly depleting fuel gauge, forcing you to do one of two things: you can shoot down other planes to refill some fuel, or you can jump out of your plane and try to hijack one from an enemy. You only have a couple of parachutes, though, so you have to be careful - if you miss your shot and don't have any left, you'll go splat. If you do have a parachute (which you can earn more of by shooting down a certain number of enemies from the same wave) you'll glide down and have to face various hazards on the road while you search for a new plane. It's refreshing how open-ended the game is laid out. Although your destination lies all the way to the right of the stage, you have free reign to go wherever you please. If you stay close to the ground you'll avoid enemies, but that also means that you'll be out of luck when you run out of fuel (which happens quickly, especially if you're using turbo). Or, you could go high and get into some seriously intense dog-fights, or even backtrack if you missed a wave of cool looking planes you want to hijack. Other decisions you have to make are based around the fuel gauge, which decreases extremely quickly. Do you focus on shooting other planes, or go the more risky route by trying to hijack? The former is usually the safe bet, but it's incredibly fun to try out all the new planes being thrown your way. You have to be careful, though, as hijacking different enemies produces different effects. While other planes are typically a safe bet, other enemies are sometimes not. For example, trying to hijack the flying pigs results in you either wasting a parachute or falling to your death, and UFO's zap you if you try to get on them. Though there isn't as much variety in the levels as I would like, there are constantly new enemies thrown at you, which are really the star of the show anyway. Through and through the action stays frantic and intense, with some opportunities for some really memorable moments. It's a perfect example of the easy to pick up, hard to master philosophy of game design. Newcomers can have a blast even when they're dying every twenty seconds, and it's an absolute blast trying to perfect your game. While I'm not usually into self-imposed challenges, it's super fun trying to finish a level without dying and keeping the same plane. Graphically, the game is astounding for 1984, and still serves the game nicely today. The colors are very bright and vivid, the cartoony art style is great, and everything moves at a brisk pace. The audio design don't fare as well, though - get ready for a lot of bleeps and bloops. One other thing to note is that, unlike so many games of the era, you don't have to start over at the beginning when you die. Instead, you start right back from where you left off. I can't express how delighted I was to find that out, because although it might be ""hardcore"", it simply sucks having to replay the beginning over and over again in other games. It might be a bit obscure, and it's not perfect, but as far as I'm concerned Acrobatic Dog-Fight is a classic and an absolute must-play.

The game is played between two sides (either a computer-controlled opponent or a second player) on a fixed screen. The two sides each control a launcher vehicle that can shoot missiles. The player needs to reconstruct the shape as shown in the top window. This is done by solving a sliding puzzle. In early levels shapes only contain three or four blocks with a single colour, while later levels introduce complex shapes with multiple colours. If a shape is successfully created a new one is provided. Behind the board, blocks with different types of missiles are hidden with a lay-out that is changed with each new shape. If a shape is formed on top of a missile block, the missile is launched. That way, not only creating the shape is sufficient, the player also needs to strategize to move the shape in a certain direction to cover as many missiles as possible. When a missile is launched this is shown near the top of the screen. It travels across the map and either collides with a missile of the opponent or with the launcher vehicle itself. When the latter occurs a green part of the map is coloured in and conquered. The goal however is not to conquer the entire map or to destroy the opponent, the player needs to reach a certain level before too many hits are sustained. In the first stage for instance level ten needs to be reached, meaning the player has to construct ten shapes before being destroyed. The missile aspect can however not be ignored or too much damage will be received before the required level can be reached. Some board lay-outs have a special red missile that clears the entire line of missiles on the screen instead of just one. At the start of the stage the player also receives a number of missiles that can be fired right away in emergency situations. After a successfully completed stage a bonus is provided through a slot machine mechanic. When there are two players both boards are shown and there is a time limit. When playing against the computer there is no time limit, but the computer's board is hidden. The game has no real story and the regions/countries on the map are fictional, but both Saddam Hussein (Iraq) and George H. W.

The game differs from most others in the genre in that you can change the aircraft you use at the start of each level. The jet fighter always shoots straight forward; power-ups increase the width and strength of its shots. The helicopter fires thinner and weaker shots, but turns in the direction it moves (similar to the later Zero Gunner), giving it great range; powerups increase the strength of shots, as well as the number of bullets per shot (adding a small ""spread"" effect to the shot while moving around).
Both the fighter and the helicopter also start with three bombs which wipe out everything in their path, including enemy shots. These bombs are also unique compared to similar games, in that they produce a line of small horizontal blasts that can be ""directed"" at the line travels across the ground, by pressing left and right (similar to the helicopter's shots). Additional bombs can be picked up during the course of the game.

The players take control of up to three of four characters: Dutch, Linn, a Predator hunter, and a Predator warrior, and battle the Aliens through several environments. In the process, the characters discover that the Alien presence on Earth is the result of an experiment headed by a renegade General Bush of the U.S. Colonial Marines in conjunction with the Weyland-Yutani corporation. They destroy the Alien hive by crashing a military ship into San Drad, causing a huge explosion. The Predator warrior then gives his wrist blades to Dutch and Linn in recognition of their skills as warriors, before the Predators depart back into space."

Players take the role of either Lieutenant Ellen Ripley or Corporal Dwayne Hicks as they fight their way through Xenomorphs before killing their Queen, which is a stowaway in the Sulaco. Three of the levels also featured Newt, where the players must rescue her from the Aliens.

Aliens is primarily a side-scrolling shooter in which the player must defend against various Aliens, with certain parts of the game switching to a third-person rail shooter perspective. Players can play as either Ellen Ripley or Corporal Hicks, who both begin the game with a smart gun and can upgrade to other weapons such as flamethrowers and missile or grenade launchers. The player is given several health points, one of which is lost if the player is attacked by an Alien. The player loses a life if all the health points are lost, and the game ends if all the player's lives are depleted. Boss enemies are encountered at the end of each level, with the final boss being the Alien Queen, which the player fights with a power exoskeleton loader. A two-player mode is also available. The enemies range from standard ones seen in the films to specialized ones created exclusively for this game. When fighting the Alien Queen, two victorious outcomes are possible. In the first, the player simply opens the airlock, as in the 1986 film. If the player chooses, they can fight the Queen further, wearing her down until she bursts apart.

In Japan, Game Machine listed Aliens on their April 15, 1990 issue as being the second most-successful table arcade unit of the year.[7]

Aliens on arcades was met with mostly positive reception from reviewers. Upon release, Julian Rignall of Computer and Video Games gave Aliens an overall score of 91%, noting its ""simply brilliant"" graphics and describing it as ""one of the goriest coin-ops since Splatterhouse.""[6] CU Amiga gave Aliens a 44 percent rating and criticized its ""uniformly bland and drab"" graphics, its ""irritatingly unresponsive"" controls, and its ""dull"" action.[4] Robin Hogg of Zzap!64 gave it a positive outlook. Both Martin Gaksch and Heinrich Lenhardt of German magazine Power Play also gave Aliens a positive outlook.[11] Crash's Mark Caswell praised the visuals. Brett Alan Weiss of AllGame gave Aliens three and a half stars, calling it an ""enjoyably fast-paced"" and ""graphically creepy, smoothly animated game"".

More than a decade and a half later, Retro Gamer editor-in-chief Darran Jones praised it as a ""superb"" game. In a more reserved opinion, Stephen Kleckner of VentureBeat included Aliens in his list of ""must-play"" Alien franchise games, but wrote it ""is competent and entertaining for a quarter sucker, but it lacks the creative push in gameplay found in other entries on this list."" Den of Geek's Ryan Lambie described it as ""one of the best Alien games ever."""

As in Pac-Man, the player is opposed by enemies who kill on contact. The enemies gradually increase in number as the player advances from one level to the next, and their speed also increases. On odd-numbered levels, the player controls an ape (in some versions labeled ""Copier"") and must collect coconuts while avoiding headhunters (labeled ""Police"" and ""Thief""). On even-numbered levels, the player controls a paint roller (labeled ""Rustler"") and must paint over each spot of the board while avoiding pigs (labeled ""Cattle"" and ""Thief""). Each level is followed by a short bonus stage.

Whenever a rectangular portion of the board is cleared (either by collecting all surrounding coconuts, or painting all surrounding edges), the rectangle is colored in, and in the even levels, bonus points are awarded (In odd-numbered levels, the player collects points for each coconut eaten). When the player clears all four corners of the board, he is briefly empowered to kill the enemies by touching them (just as when Pac-Man uses a ""power pill""). Enemies killed in this way fall to the bottom of the screen and revitalize themselves after a few moments.

The game controls consist of a joystick and a single button labeled ""Jump,"" which can be used up to three times, resetting after a level is cleared or the player loses a life. Pressing the jump button does not cause the player to jump, but causes all the enemies to jump, enabling the player to walk under them.

This game takes the player through several sections of the facility, including a warehouse and tunnels. The player character is tasked, along with fellow Special Tactical Advanced Alien Response (STAAR) members Lieutenant Stephanie Grant and Sergeant Major Marcus Bradley, to penetrate Area 51 and activate the nuclear self-destruct sequence. The player must defeat genetically modified zombie soldiers and aliens without harming any allied STAAR team members. If nothing but three STAAR team members are shot, the Kronn Hunter mode is started, taking the role of a Hunter, sent by the Kronn to eliminate the rebels.

There are five types of weaponry available. While the player is only given a semi-automatic pistol in the beginning, weapon upgrades are available as targets. The pistol can be upgraded to an automatic machine gun, a pump shotgun, and finally an automatic shotgun. The shotgun weaponry allows a greater field of error for targeting an enemy. Both the machine gun and automatic shotgun allow the player to keep the trigger pressed down to unleash rounds. If the player character is hit by the enemy at any time, the weapon is downgraded back to the pistol.

Grenades are hidden in crates and bonus rooms. When used, they destroy most on screen enemies at once. The player can hold a maximum of nine grenades. In addition, yellow boxes and barrels marked with ""flammable"" warning symbols can be shot to cause fires or explosions that can harm enemies. By shooting certain objects in the correct sequence, players can unlock shooting exercises, weapon stashes, and bonus items that are not available in the main game plot. Other backdoors allow players to warp ahead to later levels instead of following the game's otherwise linear path.

There are many types of aliens/alien zombies including ones that shoot, punch, fire rockets, and throw things like bricks, grenades, and barrels. Purple alien/alien zombies require more hits than other targets."

Area 51: Site 4 is the sequel to the 1995 arcade video game, Area 51.

The game is divided into two sections, ""Field Exercises"" and ""Beyond Area 51,"" and the player may choose which one to play first. Field Exercises allows the player to choose one of three levels (Sites 1, 2, and 3), ranked by difficulty and each consisting of six missions that may be played in any order. Every mission requires the player to meet a stated objective, such as shooting a set number of attacking zombies or aliens, destroying missiles before they can reach Earth, or stopping aliens from overturning a bus. One life is lost whenever the player fails a mission, and the success threshold is set lower for the next attempt; if all lives are lost, the game ends. The player earns a score bonus for completing all six missions at a site, and can earn special weapons or unlock secret areas by shooting certain objects in the background.

Beyond Area 51 sends the player to Site 4, in a mission resembling gameplay of the original Area 51. Special weapons earned in the Field Exercises can be used during this portion of the game, in which the player enters a vast warehouse infested by aliens. The final boss is a giant alien queen with multiple limbs, who must be destroyed within a time limit. The game ends when the player either runs out of lives due to shooting S.T.A.A.R. agents or being hit by enemy attacks, or runs out of time without destroying the queen.

After the game is beaten, a short sequence of clips is played involving S.T.A.A.R. members, ending with the message, ""S.T.A.A.R.

Hold down catch button to rescue falling citizens and catch falling cars. Shoot or catch rubble before it crushes someone. Game ends when no citizens remain. This caped superhero game is a very rare unreleased prototype. The game was originally called 'Protector' (the official test name was 'VideoMan'). Tom wanted Gottlieb to get the Superman license but they didn't. 'VideoMan' was too close to 'SuperMan' so they went with 'Protector', but the name was also changed at one point to 'Guardian', and then 'Argus' (designers' joke name became 'ProVidGuardArgus'). During a couple of focus group tests of the game, players suggested using a joystick instead of a trackball to control the superhero (Test players perceived the results as the trackball performing badly). Tom did that. It was worse. Unfortunately, there are some kinds of action that should not be controlled by a proportional controller (unless it has tactile feedback) - Argus had this kind of game action. Argus did have some fun stuff, like the ability to knock chunks out of buildings (Warren did the rubble stuff) and pick up a city bus. The game may have been buggy, Tom was not the best designer or programmer, but the game design was primarily responsible for it's failure to test well. You have to remember that this was early days in computer game design and there were lots of elaborate ways to fail for the first time. Tom was a pioneer in his own way. Argus's failure was hard to accept, as ""Reactor"" had not done well either."

The plot involves the starship Arkanoid being attacked by a mysterious entity from space named DOH. A small paddle-shaped craft, the Vaus, is ejected from the Arkanoid.

The player controls the Vaus, moving it from side to side in order to hit a ball into an pattern of bricks and destroy them. After all bricks have been destroyed, the player advances to the next level and faces a new pattern. Most bricks can be destroyed in one hit; some require multiple hits, and others cannot be destroyed at all. Some bricks release capsules that bestow various power-ups when caught, such as increasing the length of the Vaus, temporarily slowing the ball down, or granting an extra life. Floating enemies/obstacles emerge onto the screen at times and can be hit for bonus points.

On the final stage, the player takes on the game's boss, ""DOH"". Once this point is reached, the player no longer has the option to continue after running out of lives, making this segment more difficult. The game is over regardless of the outcome.

If the player succeeds in defeating ""DOH"", the game rewards them by showing the ending, in which time starts to flow backwards, and Vaus escapes the distorted space just in time to return to the Arkanoid, which has also reversed back to perfect condition.

The final boss is always Mr. Big, though as mentioned earlier, an extra match will be played against Geese Howard if the player unlocks him through good performance.

The objective of Asteroids is to destroy asteroids and saucers. The player controls a triangular ship that can rotate left and right, fire shots straight forward, and thrust forward. Once the ship begins moving in a direction, it will continue in that direction for a time without player intervention unless the player applies thrust in a different direction. The ship eventually comes to a stop when not thrusting. The player can also send the ship into hyperspace, causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen, at the risk of self-destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid.

Each level starts with a few large asteroids drifting in various directions on the screen. Objects wrap around screen edges – for instance, an asteroid that drifts off the top edge of the screen reappears at the bottom and continues moving in the same direction. As the player shoots asteroids, they break into smaller asteroids that move faster and are more difficult to hit. Smaller asteroids are also worth more points. Two flying saucers appear periodically on the screen; the ""big saucer"" shoots randomly and poorly, while the ""small saucer"" fires frequently at the ship. After reaching a score of 40,000, only the small saucer appears. As the player's score increases, the angle range of the shots from the small saucer diminishes until the saucer fires extremely accurately. Once the screen has been cleared of all asteroids and flying saucers, a new set of large asteroids appears, thus starting the next level. The game gets harder as the number of asteroids increases until after the score reaches a range between 40,000 and 60,000. The player starts with 3–5 lives upon game start and gains an extra life per 10,000 points. Play continues to the last ship lost, which ends the game.

During their turn, players move one of their pieces either one or two spaces in any direction.

If the destination is adjacent to the source, a new piece is created on the empty departure square. Otherwise the piece on the source moves to the destination.

You must then shoot the dynamite to get rid of it.

If you're lucky, either a man or a woman will throw you a bag of gold coins. If you shoot any of these people by accident, you also lose a life. More often than not, the person will throw his/her hands up, saying ""I haven't got anything"". That's when they will be replaced by bandits.

Some men will carry three to five pieces of gold on top of their heads, and shooting at all of the gold will award you with a bag of gold coins. Others will be tied up with rope.

The title translates to ""exceptional"" or ""extraordinary"".

Originally developed for the arcade, Batsugun was first released in 1993. A second edition named Batsugun Special Version was shown at the AOU (Arcade Operators Union) show in Japan but was never released as Toaplan slid into bankruptcy. After Toaplan's bankruptcy, the Special Version appeared on the secondhand market. The two revisions were released on the Sega Saturn in 1996 as a single package coded by Toaplan offshoot Gazelle.

Heralded by some as the first ""manic shooter"", Batsugun's development involved employees who would go on to form and work at Cave and continue to work in this subgenre. This includes the game's chief programmer Tsuneki Ikeda. Batsugun saw an evolution in the use of complex enemy wave and bullet patterns, and player firepower and hit-box.

The Special Edition featured a number of changes including a smaller hitbox, a shield protecting the player from one hit, more powerful bombs, new scoring items, and the addition of multiple game rounds or loops of increasing difficulty.

The Saturn releases are nearly the same but differ from the arcade versions in subtle ways, including rearranged music and lack of slowdown in some cases which can make the game more difficult."

The game uses wireframe vector graphics displayed on a black and white vector monitor. A colored overlay tints the display green for the bottom 4⁄5 where the action takes place, and red for the top 1⁄5 where the score and radar screen are displayed.

The player drives a tank using two joysticks, one controlling the right tread and the other the left. By moving the joysticks relative to each other, the tank can move forward or reverse (both moved in the same direction), turn on the spot to the left or right (one forward, one back) or move and turn at a slower rate (one forward or backward, one neutral). The right-side stick also has a fire button on top, which fires the player's gun in the direction the tank is currently facing.

Gameplay takes place on a flat plane with a mountainous horizon featuring an erupting volcano, distant crescent moon, and various geometric solids (in vector outline) like pyramids and blocks. The geometric solid obstacles are indestructible and can block the movement of a player's tank while also blocking shots and can be used as shields. The action surrounds the player in all directions, including off-screen locations, forcing the player to locate the enemy using the radar display at the top of the screen.

There are three types of enemy craft that appear during play, one at a time. At the start of a game, the enemy is dominated by slow tanks that are not particularly difficult to hit even when moving. As the game continues, missiles begin to appear in place of the enemy tanks; these move much faster and are more difficult to hit. Finally, the much faster supertanks appear at higher levels, which are not only harder to hit but also attack more aggressively.

Periodically saucer-shaped UFOs will appear while making a distinctive sound to announce their presence; these do not appear on the radar and do not attack the user, but can be shot for bonus points. This is the only object that may appear while other enemies are already present.

There is a gameplay modification at 100,000 points if the proper conditions are met. When executed properly, the next appearing supertank will not attack but will instead retreat. A tank icon will then appear at right on qualified high score listings."

"Bermuda Triangle","","Region Not Set","","SNK","SNK","1987-11-01","2","No","Shooter","","The SYD mission was successful, but the current era was only one place under attack. The invaders also traveled back in time, hoping to rewrite history. Only the six experimental space-time battleships known as ZIG could stop them, but they were attacked upon taking off. Now trapped in the past, they have no way to return to the present.

Bermuda Triangle is a scrolling shooter designed by the same team as Ikari Warriors. The player must survive each of the 9 levels, which automatically scroll both up and down, long enough to reach and destroy the boss. The ZIG, being a much larger ship than most scrolling shooter ships, can sustain several hits before being destroyed, and has both a straight ahead shot and a rotating turret that can fire in 8 directions. SYD ships can be picked up in levels and will fly near the ZIG in four different formations. They can block enemy shots but will be destroyed if hit by enemy ships. Energy can be picked up as well, which will either restore lost health or, at full health, power up the attack of the ZIG and SYDs.

The arcade version uses a rotary joystick to control the turret, but the PlayStation port places the turret controls on the shoulder buttons."
"Berzerk","","NTSC-U","United States of America","Stern Electronics, Inc.","Stern Electronics","1980-11-12","2","No","Action | Shooter","E - Everyone","Berzerk is a 1980 arcade video game developed and released by Stern Electronics in the USA on November 12, 1980.

When the game begins, the player controls a green stick man on the left of the screen. In two-player games, the second player controls a purple stick man on the right of the screen. Each player plays until they lose a life, allowing the other player to have a turn.

Using a joystick and a firing button that activates a laser-style weapon, the player navigates a simple maze filled with many robots, who fire lasers back at the player character. A player can be killed by being shot, by running into a robot or an exploding robot, getting electrocuted by the electrified walls of the maze itself, or by being touched by the player's nemesis, Evil Otto.

The function of Evil Otto, represented by a bouncing smiley face, is to quicken the pace of the game. Otto is unusual, with regard to games of the period, in that he's indestructible. Otto can go through walls with impunity and hunts the player character. If robots remain in the maze Otto moves slowly, about half as fast as the humanoid, but he speeds up to match the humanoid's speed once all the robots are killed. Evil Otto moves at exactly the same speed as the player going left and right but he can move faster than the player going up and down; thus, no matter how close Otto is, the player can escape as long as they can avoid moving straight up or down.

The player advances by escaping from the maze through an opening in the far wall. Each robot destroyed is worth 50 points. If all the robots in the current maze have been destroyed before the player escapes, the player gains ten points per robot. The game has 65,536 rooms (256×256 grid), but due to limitations of the random number generation there are fewer than 1,024 maze layouts (876 of which are unique). It has only one controller, but two-player games can be accomplished by alternating at the joystick.

As a player's score increases, the colors of the enemy robots change, and the robots can have more bullets on the screen at the same time. Once they reach the limit of simultaneous on-screen bullets, they cannot fire again until one or more of their bullets detonates; the limit applies to the robots as a group, not as individuals.

A free life can be awarded at 5,000 or 10,000 points, set by internal DIP switches, with no extra lives thereafter.

The game's voice synthesizer generates speech for the robots during certain in-game events:

""Coin detected in pocket"": During attract mode, specifically while showing the high score list.
""Intruder alert! Intruder alert!"": Spoken when Evil Otto appears.
""The humanoid must not escape"" or ""The intruder must not escape"": Heard when the player escapes a room after destroying every robot.
""Chicken, fight like a robot"": Heard when the player escapes a room without destroying every robot.
""Got the humanoid, got the intruder!"": Heard when the player loses a life (the ""got the intruder"" part is a minor third higher than the ""got the humanoid"" part).
There is random robot chatter playing in the background, with phrases usually consisting of ""Charge"", ""Attack"", ""Kill"", ""Destroy"", ""Shoot"", or ""Get"", followed by ""The Humanoid"", ""The intruder"", ""it"", or ""the chicken"" (the last only if the player got the ""Chicken, fight like a robot"" message from the previous room), creating sentences such as ""Attack it"", ""Get the Humanoid"", ""Destroy the intruder"", ""Kill the chicken"", and so on. The speed and pitch of the phrases vary, from deep and slow, to high and fast; as well as different versions of the game being translated into four different languages such as English, French, German, and Spanish."

The game features a 2D side-scrolling shoot 'em up style of gameplay and the character chosen by the player can be moved in 8 directions. The player can move, shoot, dodge, and block. To block an enemy projectile, the player must place the power star in the path of the projectile. There is also an array of different weapons at the ships' disposal.

The player will begin with a pre-set number of lives, from 1 to 5, 3 being the default. When a player is hit by a hostile creature or environment, their ship is destroyed and will reappear with one less life. Extra lives are attainable by absorbing 1-UP icons in the various stages, or reaching milestones for accumulating points without getting Game Over. 20,000, 50,000 and 100,000 points are the first three.

The game also features strong usage of deep, bass-heavy music tracks, creative and colorful artwork and foreground and background elements. Despite the many obstacles in the scenery and landscape, the player cannot be harmed or die by bumping into anything other than an enemy or enemy fire. Players can, however, die by being crushed between the screen's edge and a wall. Scrolling and enemy movement is extremely fast in comparison to other games of its time.

Gameplay in Blade Strangers takes place on a 2D plane and features two characters battling one another until one character's health is depleted, causing them to lose the match. The game avoids the use of more complex directional inputs seen in other fighting games; instead, players perform various attacks and special moves by pressing a single directional input in combination with one or more of the four attack buttons, similar to the Super Smash Bros. series. During battle, players can build their super meter by dealing or receiving damage, which can be used to enhance their special moves or perform powerful super attacks. When a player character's health depletes below a certain level, the player is able to activate a temporary ""Heat Up!"" state. This can only be used once per round for a short time, and will increase the player character's attack speed while preventing opponents from interrupting the player's attacks.

Blade Strangers offers a single-player story mode, with characters interacting with one another while progressing through a tournament ladder, along with arcade, survival, training and challenge modes. The game also supports local and online multiplayer battles. [4]

Characters
The launch roster of Blade Strangers featured 12 playable characters drawn from six different independent game franchises, primarily other Studio Saizensen and Nicalis works, along with two original characters for a total roster of 14. Three additional characters were added via a free update on the game's first anniversary, bringing the total to 17.[5] Each character also receives a stage based on their game of origin.[6]

Plot
In the world of Blade Strangers, every universe is one of many simulations being generated by an interdimensional network of servers. These simulations are overseen by the goddess Exiva and her Motes, a group of sentient computers, and protected by their champions, the Blade Strangers. A cybernetic being known as Lina appears and begins consuming the servers' data, wiping out whole worlds and defeating all of the Blade Strangers. To protect the universe, the motes summon heroes from worlds Lina has not yet reached, altering their memories to make them believe they are participating in a fighting tournament. The one left standing will be named the new Blade Stranger in the hopes of awakening their power and allowing them to defeat Lina.[7]

Development
Blade Strangers was announced on June 12, 2017 during E3 2017.[8] New characters were revealed gradually in the months leading up to the game's release.[9] The game was initially developed independently by Studio Saizensen, and primarily featured characters from games they had previously created. When Nicalis became the game's publisher, they offered additional suggestions for potential playable characters, and worked with each character's rights holders to include them in the roster.[10] The game's character sprites were created by designing three-dimensional models for each fighter, rendering them in individual animation frames, then rasterizing those frames and performing additional cleanup by 2D artists.[11] According to director Toshinobu Kondo, the development team initially struggled to maintain balance due to some characters possessing weapons that gave them extra advantages.[12] The decision to simplify player inputs was due to a desire to make the game more accessible to those who do not normally play fighting games, as well as to reduce the data transfer and resulting input lag during online multiplayer battles.[11] The game's soundtrack was composed and performed by American rock band Ridiculon, with additional vocals performed by Siobhan Magnus.[13] For the first anniversary of the game's launch, a free in-game update was released that made several changes, including improved graphics, faster gameplay speed, a full rebalancing of the character roster, and three additional playable characters.[14]"

"Blast Off","","Region Not Set","","Namco","Namco","1989-01-01","2","No","Shooter","","As in many other vertical scrolling shooters (including Namco's own Xevious), the player controls a ship, facing the top of the screen, that can move freely while the background scrolls down, bringing enemies in to view; the player may destroy enemies for points. The game uses two buttons - one is used to make the ship fire circular lasers, while the other is used to cycle through its four firing patterns. The red pattern is two lasers in a spiral pattern, while the blue one is one laser straight ahead and one behind, the yellow one is one laser straight ahead, one left, and one right and the green one is two lasers diagonally forward (one to the left and one to the right), and one straight behind; by holding down the button, the ship fires more powerful, spherical lasers.

Even though the game is the sequel to Bosconian (which used a synthesized, DAC-generated voice saying ""Blast off!"" at the beginning of every round), Blast Off had more in common gameplay-wise with Namco's own Dragon Spirit than with Bosconian; this is especially noticeable in the third area of every world, where the player's ship undergoes an increase in size, and must destroy a boss. Despite several gameplay differences, the connection with Bosconian was emphasized in the marketing of the game, with the hexagonal space stations from Bosconian appearing in Namco's press literature, and on the game's title screen, and also making appearances in the game itself - and the game is also worth noting for its usages of various Engrish phrases, such as ""To push start only 1 player button"" (on title screen), ""Go next"" (at end of world), ""Congraturations"" (at end of game) and ""Entry your name"" (on high score table). There are a total of six worlds in this game, and each one has three areas (so there are a total of eighteen ""stages"" to play through)."

It is a spiritual sequel to Cabal, with almost identical mechanics. A bootleg of this game is known as West Story.

In 'Blood Bros., two blood brothers, a cowboy and an Indian, team-up to hunt down ""the most wanted outlaw in Dodge City,"" Big Bad John. The gameplay mechanics are extremely similar to TAD Corp.'s earlier machine, Cabal, however this game did not seem to appear as a trackball-controlled variant.

The player's characters are seen from behind. Some screens feature protective walls (which can get damaged and shattered by enemy fire). The players have limitless ammunition for their primary gun, but a limited number of sticks of dynamite, with which they must fend off enemy troops. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen depletes as foes are destroyed and certain structural features of the screen (usually the ones that collapse when destroyed, rather than simply shattering) are brought down. At the successful completion of a level by fully depleting the enemy gauge, all the remaining buildings onscreen collapse and the player progresses to the next stage, reprising the amusing ""victory dance walk"" into the horizon from Cabal. Boss fights, however, start from the beginning if a player dies.

Power-ups appear from time to time, being released from objects destroyed onscreen or special characters who may run across, such as the small Indian Chief figure or warthogs. Points and weaponry can also be dispensed from the tin can, if you shoot it into the air and juggle it with subsequent shots. Some power-ups give special weapons with increased firepower, others grant extra dynamite or additional points. Two players could play this game, cooperatively, simultaneously."

"Blood Storm","BloodStorm","Region Not Set","","Strata","Incredible Technologies, Inc.","1994-07-01","2","No","Fighting","","The Mega War, fought centuries ago, left the earth in global ruins.  The
destructive nuclear horrors unleashed upon the planet and its population
created uncountable amounts of death and devastation.  In the wake of this
sweeping havoc arose the planet itself to retaliate against the violence
forced upon it.  Polar shifts and massive earthquakes swallowed entire
continents.  From seething seas and walls of water arose angry volcanoes,
spewing flame and death into the sky.  Hungry fires, searing blizzards, and
brutal storms ran rampant across the planet's surface for years, in an attempt
to wash away the man-made horrors that it was forced to endure.
 
At last the earth settled into a new pattern, starting to find some
semblance of balance and peace.  The global changes had left a much harsher
planet, and the remaining life forms adapted slowly to the new environment.
The Earth's land masses, altered by man-made weaponry and ended through
elemental means, had evolved into ten isolated provinces.  The remaining
populations within these new provinces found life difficult at first, but
slowly evolution and natural selection allowed the human race to adapt and
once again gain control of their destiny.  Some of the provinces had strong
natural forces, exposed through the abrupt upheaval, and the resourceful
post-humans began to master these new powers.  Other provinces continued to
develop through the use of science and technology, creating elaborate life
support systems and protection against the harsh environments.
 
As the years progressed, eight of the provinces began to communicate and
trade together.  An alliance was formed and a global quasi-government was
established.  The social structure evolved into a mixture of medieval
practices, hybrid technology, and barbarism and barter.
 
Centuries have passed and the present day Earth finds mankind again at the
brink of savagery and destruction.  Life is now a series of hardships,
deceptions, and lies for the members of the Provincial Alliance.  The frozen
tundra of Polaria and the volcanic Scorch are very close to all out war,
halted only by the desolate, radioactive Death Zone that separates them.  The
Death Zone, once a founding member of the Planet Alliance, has remained silent
for almost two centuries, hiding behind the mysterious and deadly red mists
that define its borders.  Obsel, the desert province, has been taken over by
desperate and brutal female terrorists.  The Ebony Coast, known for its trade
and bartering systems, is now led by a mysterious and greedy leader whom no
one trusts, yet all must tolerate.  The people of Cyberia, a land inhabitable
only through technological means, have re-engineered their population, and are
losing their humanity to the machine.
 
With tensions running high, the Planet Alliance is beginning to falter and
the provinces are no longer considered allies.  And now the High Emperor, the
one guiding force that all provinces had agreed to abide by, has been
mysteriously and horribly murdered.
 
The ancient Provincial Agreement declares that a new ruler must be chosen
through combat between the rulers of each province.  Each province will come
prepared for battle with their own Gauntlet of Ascension, a gloved weapon that
only those in power may don.  These ancient gauntlets are treasured and
revered by their people, for they are the foremost symbol of power and honor
each province can have.
 
But it is painfully clear that this tournament will not have the honor of
previous BloodStorm contests.  There have even been rumors that the combatants
will bring back the Sunder Attack, a brutal combat move that separated the
opponent's legs from his body without killing him.  This horrible and
humiliating maneuver has never been officially banned from the BloodStorm
contest, yet it is so brutal and degrading that no honorable combatant has
used it for centuries.  However, these champions from radically different
provinces are blind to the mysterious evil that surrounds the High Emperor's
death, and instead only see their opportunity for personal gain, provincial
expansion, or race domination and will do anything to achieve their goals.
 
 
The BloodStorm is about to begin!"

The player controls a biplane which can either shoot or hook enemies. The biggest characteristic of the biplane is the hook attached to its rear section. Enemies or objects that come in contact with the hook are dragged along by the plane. Dragged objects cause damage to anything they collide with, and the player can release the objects on the hook by pressing the hook button again. Dragged objects are destroyed when the player releases them from the hook, or if they collide enough times to break apart.

The ship's power gauge increases when the player taps the shot button rapidly, and filling up the gauge causes the plane to shoot a bolt of lightning that covers a large area of the screen. However, the plane overheats if the player taps the shot button too many times, so this attack must be used sparingly.

The game's graphics are highly detailed, and many of the backgrounds are likened to European towns and cities or World's fair-like scenes. Many of the game's background objects can also be destroyed or dragged around with the hook."

The objective of Bosconian is to score as many points as possible by destroying enemy missiles and bases. The player controls the Starfighter, a ship that can move in eight directions and fires both forward and backward simultaneously. Throughout the game, the Starfighter stays affixed to the center of the screen as it moves. During each round, several green enemy bases — known as ""base stars"" — appear, all of which must be destroyed in order to advance to the next round. The number of bases increases with each round. Each base has six globe-like cannons arranged in a hexagon around a central core. To destroy a base, the player must either shoot the core or destroy all six cannons, the latter of which gives the player extra points. In later levels, cores begin defending themselves by opening and closing while launching missiles. A radar display on the right-hand side of the screen shows where enemies are located relative to the player. The game also features a color-coded alert system with voice commands.

Additionally, the player must avoid or destroy stationary asteroids, mines, and a variety of enemy missiles and ships which attempt to collide with his or her ship. Enemy bases will also occasionally launch a squadron of ships in formation attacks — destroying the leader causes all remaining enemies to disperse, but destroying all enemies in a formation scores extra bonus points. A spy ship will also appear occasionally, which must be destroyed or the game's alert system will turn to red regardless of how long the player has taken. Throughout the game, a digitized voice alerts the player to various events, such as incoming enemies or an approaching spy ship."

The color order from the bottom up is yellow, green, orange and red. Using a single ball, the player must knock down as many bricks as possible by using the walls and the paddle below to hit the ball against the bricks and eliminate them. If the player's paddle misses the ball's rebound, they will lose a turn. The player has three turns to try to clear two screens of bricks. Yellow bricks earn one point each, green bricks earn three points, orange bricks earn five points and the top-level red bricks score seven points each. The paddle shrinks to one-half its size after the ball has broken through the red row and hit the upper wall. Ball speed increases at specific intervals: after four hits, after twelve hits, and after making contact with the orange and red rows.

The highest score achievable for one player is 864; this is done by eliminating two screens of bricks worth 432 points per screen. Once the second screen of bricks is destroyed, the ball in play harmlessly bounces off empty walls until the player restarts the game, as no additional screens are provided. However, a secret way to score beyond the 864 maximum is to play the game in two-player mode. If ""Player One"" completes the first screen on their third and last ball, then immediately and deliberately allows the ball to ""drain"", Player One's second screen is transferred to ""Player Two"" as a third screen, allowing Player Two to score a maximum of 1,312 points if they are adept enough to keep the third ball in play that long. Once the third screen is eliminated, the game is over.

The original arcade cabinet of Breakout has artwork framing the game's plot as a prison escape. The player is one of a prison's inmates attempting to knock a ball and chain into a wall of their prison cell with a mallet.

In Bubble Bobble, each player controls one of the two dragons. Players can move along platforms, fall to lower ones, and jump to higher ones and over gaps. Each level is limited to a single screen, with no left/right scrolling; however, if a screen has gaps in its bottom edge, players can fall through these and reappear at the top. Each level has a certain number of enemies that must be defeated in order to advance. The players must blow bubbles to trap the enemies, then burst these bubbles by colliding with them. Each enemy defeated in this manner turns into a food item that can be picked up for extra points. Defeating multiple enemies at once awards higher scores and causes more valuable food items to appear. All bubbles will float for a certain length of time before bursting on their own; players can jump on these and ride them to otherwise inaccessible areas. Magic items appear from time to time and grant special abilities and advantages when picked up. Special bubbles occasionally appear that can be burst to attack enemies with fire, water, or lightning. Furthermore, if a player collects letter bubbles to spell the word EXTEND, a bonus life is earned and both players immediately advance to the next level.

A player loses one life upon touching any free enemies or their projectiles (rocks, fireballs, lasers, bottles). Enemies turn ""angry""—turning pink in color and moving faster—if they escape from a bubble after being left too long or the players spend a certain amount of time on the current level. They return to normal if either player loses a life. After a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These disappear once the level is cleared, or when a player loses a life. When there is only one enemy left, it immediately becomes angry and remains in this state until defeated.

In the 100th and final level, players face a boss. This is one of the first games to feature multiple endings. Completing Level 100 in single-player mode reveals a message stating that the game has not truly ended and a hint to the player: ""Come here with your friend"". If two players complete the game, they see a ""happy end"", in which the brothers are transformed to their human selves and reunited with their girlfriends. This ending also includes a code that, when deciphered, allows the game to be played in the faster and more difficult ""super"" mode. If this mode is completed with two players, a second ""happy end"" is displayed in which Super Drunk (the defeated boss) is revealed to be the brothers' parents under the control of some outside influence. The brothers return to normal and are reunited with their parents and girlfriends.

Also, if the player(s) reach levels 20, 30, or 40 without losing a life, a doorway will appear in each of those levels, transporting the player to a secret room and displaying a coded message that, once decoded, gives the player a major hint / spoiler on how to beat the game."

In Bubbles, the player controls a soap bubble from a top-down perspective. The object is to clean a kitchen sink by maneuvering over ants, crumbs, and grease spots to absorb them before they slide into the drain. As the bubble absorbs more objects, it grows in size, eventually acquiring first eyes and then a smiling mouth. At the same time, sponges and scrub brushes slowly move around the sink, cleaning it on their own in competition with the player. Touching either of these enemies costs a player one life unless the bubble is large enough to have a complete face. In this case, the enemy will be knocked away and the bubble will shrink. Sponges and brushes can be knocked into the drain for bonus points, eliminating them from play. Two other enemies in the sink are stationary razor blades and roaches that crawl out of the drain. Contact with a blade is always fatal, while the bubble can safely touch the roach only while carrying a broom, which will kill the roach with one hit. The broom can be acquired by running over a cleaning lady who appears in the sink from time to time.

A level ends when all of the point-scoring objects are gone - either lost down the drain, cleaned by sponges/brushes, eaten by roaches, or absorbed by the bubble. At this point, if the bubble is large enough to have a complete face, the player moves on to the next level; otherwise, one life is lost and the level must be replayed. In addition, whenever the bubble has a face, the drain flashes green, giving the player a chance to enter it and skip the next level. Entering the drain while the bubble is too small costs one life."

The game has only eight stages (""sectors""), with the mothership as the final (and only) boss. Clearing the game puts you on the next loop, with the message ""NICE PLAY, GO ON."" The arcade actually displays how many loops you've run (labeled as ""rounds"") as well.

At the start of the game (and at each loop), the source ship you fight at the end zooms past, and leaves a missile in its wake. It's flying higher than you can shoot so you can't damage it at all."
"Bucky O'Hare","","Region Not Set","","Konami","Konami","1992-09-01","2","Yes","Action","","This video game is based on the cartoon television series Bucky O'Hare and the Toad Wars under license from Hasbro, Inc. While it is generally classified as a scrolling fighting game, utilizing a Final Fight-esque landscape, the player's character is also armed with a laser gun, adding in elements of a scrolling shooter. However, if the character is extremely close to an enemy, he will throw out his fists to attack - a precursor to the characters featured in Metal Slug, who use knives in close combat.

Much like the cartoon, Bucky O'Hare features colorful animation, and voice actors from the series were hired to participate in the game's cut scenes.

The player chooses from five protagonists: Bucky O'Hare, the heroic rabbit captain of the space ship Righteous Indignation; Jenny, an ""Aldebaran cat"" and telepath; Dead-Eye Duck, a four-armed mallard; Willy, a kid from earth that replaced their engineer, and Blinky, a one-eyed android. As in the television series, the characters must stop the Toad Empire from invading extraterrestrial planets and enslaving their peoples; to do so they must shoot their way through an army of brainwashed toads to destroy their evil leader, a computer program known as ""Komplex"" and release the ""Interplanetary Life Force.""

The enemies, among them Al Negator, Toadborg, Total Terror Toad, a ""Cyborg Spider"", the various varieties of Toad Storm Troopers, the Toads' Air Marshall, and ""Komplex-2-Go"" who featured in the comic book and cartoon series continuities."

"Bullfight","","Region Not Set","","Sega","Sega","1984-01-01","2","No","Action","","Bullfight takes place in an overhead perspective where you, as the matador, must defeat the bull by lodging your sword into the weak spot just beneath the top of his neck. You have a fair deal of space to move in the arena, where you leave your capote perpetually outstretched. The bull often charges forth when you're close enough and sometimes aims for the capote, though you'll have to watch out for how close his head comes to the matador's body. As the bull runs by, you'll have to position yourself a fair distance so you don't get hit but close enough so your sword can reach the bull. One button attacks while the other redirects the capote to better face the bull, and as it gets close, your sword will automatically aim for the bull's small yellow weakpoint. If you graze the spot, you get some points and the circle enlarges into a green hole for a few seconds, and if you're able to strike the bullseye (pun semi-intended), the bull falls down as the sword is lodged into his backside.

Killing even the first bull is not easy, and bulls may sometimes get up and shrug off your sword, forcing you to retrieve it and stab it again to end it for good. If the bull hits you with its horns, that's the end of your current matador. Being grazed by any other part of its body only knocks you down, but getting hit head-on flings you out of the arena. An interesting touch is how your lives are represented by three different bullfighters, with your first guy wearing green, the second yellow, and the third dark blue."

The object of the game is to build a number of hamburgers while avoiding enemy foods. The player controls the protagonist, chef Peter Pepper, with a four-position joystick and a ""pepper"" button.

Each level is a maze of platforms and ladders in which giant burger ingredients (bun, meat patty, tomato, lettuce) are arranged. When Peter walks the full length of an ingredient, it falls to the level below, knocking down any ingredient that happens to be there. A burger is completed when all of its vertically aligned ingredients have been dropped out of the maze and onto a waiting plate. The player must complete all burgers to finish the board.

Three types of enemy food items wander the maze: Mr. Hot Dog, Mr. Pickle, and Mr. Egg. The player can score extra points by either crushing them under a falling ingredient or dropping an ingredient while they are on it. In the latter case, the ingredient falls two extra levels for every enemy caught on it. Crushed or dropped enemies return to the maze after a short time.

At the start of the game, the player is given a limited number of pepper shots to use against enemies. Pressing the button causes Peter to shake a cloud of pepper in the direction he is facing; any enemy touching the cloud is briefly stunned, and Peter can safely move through them. Ice cream, coffee, and French fries appear on occasion, awarding bonus points and one extra pepper shot when collected.

There are six boards of increasing difficulty, with more burgers/ingredients, more enemies, and/or layouts that make it easier for Peter to become cornered. After the player completes the sixth board, the cycle repeats. One life is lost whenever Peter touches a non-stunned enemy, and the game ends once all lives are lost."

The object of the game is to complete a number of hamburgers while avoiding enemy foods.

When main protagonist, chef Peter Pepper, the player's character, walks the length of an ingredient (bun, meat patty, tomato, etc.), it falls one level. If it lands atop another ingredient, the latter in turn falls one level. A burger is completed when all vertically aligned ingredients have been dropped out of the maze and onto a waiting plate. Once all burgers are completed, the game level is finished.

While making burgers, the player must avoid the antagonists, three types of enemies: Mr. Hot Dog, Mr. Pickle, and Mr. Egg. Enemies can be dodged, stunned, crushed with a falling ingredient, or dropped by luring them onto an ingredient and then causing it to fall. In this last case, the piece will fall two extra levels for every enemy caught on it. Enemies that have been crushed or dropped return to the maze after a few seconds. Dropped enemies award larger point values than crushed ones; therefore, to obtain a high score, the player must attract more than one enemy onto an ingredient just before dropping it.

Peter Pepper has pepper shots to shake on nearby enemies to stun and render them harmless for a few seconds. Extra shots are obtained by collecting bonus foods, such as coffee, an ice cream cone, or French fries, which appear in the center of the maze when a certain number of ingredients have dropped.

There are six screens of increasing difficulty, with more burgers and enemies, burgers that have more parts, and/or layouts that make it easier for Peter Pepper to be cornered and harder for him to reach the ingredients. Completing all six screens takes the player back to the first one."

Many ex-Capcom staff including Kouichi Yotsui (credited as Isuke), worked on the original arcade version of Strider and designed Osman as an unofficial sequel to Strider.[1] Yotsui directed both titles.

It is the late 21st century, and the world has come under the control of a single federal government. One day a new threat known as Abdullah the Slaver appears, causing widespread terror and panic. The fear in men's hearts incites the abandonment of all economic activity. The federal government, which is the foundation of capitalism and modern civilization, has become nothing less than an insidious idea that corrupts the foundations of society itself. It destroys the idiosyncrasies and variations among national viewpoints, stifling them in the name of ""freedom"" and its own internal ideals.

Judicial Affairs Director Jack Layzon alone grasps the situation, fearing the worst. He summons the lone assassin who had mastered the 'secret style'...


The controls of Osman consists of an eight-way joystick for moving the character, and three action buttons for attacking, jumping, and activating a special attack which will destroy all on-screen enemies (which has only a limited amount of uses and cannot be fully replenished until the player loses a life). The player can also climb walls and ceilings as well. The player character attacks primarily with his powerful kicks, which can fatally slice through most of the enemy soldiers in the face. Pressing down and jump will cause to slide. While sliding, the player character can do a slide kick with the attack button or grab certain enemies and flip them over with the jump button. The player can also dash by holding the joystick left or right after sliding.

There are four types of power-up capsules that the player can retrieve by destroying certain floating containers. The red capsules will increase the player character's attack power by allowing him to create body images of himself that will mimic his movement. The main character's attack power can be determined by the color of his pants. In his starting level, the character's pants will be blue, which changed to purple with the first power-up (allowing him to create one body image), followed by red (two body images) and white (four body images). The strongest attack level is black, which increases the player character's attack range. If the player takes damage from an enemy Osman's attack power will be reduced by one level. Other power-up items include a green power-up that restores one health point, a yellow power-up that increases the maximum health by one point, and a blue power-up that restores the player's complete health.[4]"

TRIVIA
Cannonball was Owen Rubin's first game at Atari. It is not known for sure if this game was ever produced, as there is no documentation or flyers of the game that have surfaced. Owen Rubin seems to think that maybe it WAS produced; however, he is unsure.

Owen wrote Cannonball while sitting in his small office at a Model 33 teletype connected to a Motorola MicBug 6800 processor, both of which were connected to simple videogame hardware. He hand-assembled the entire program--it was only 2K, but still took several months--including self-test, saving the code on punched paper tape. When his boss reviewed the game and asked for code listings, Owen said, 'What listings?' It turns out that Owen didn't know about the two computer operators, who took the listings that the designers/programmers wrote up, typed them into the PDP-1 computers, ran them to make sure they were error-free, then return a paper tape to the designer.

Three rows of targets scroll across the screen in alternating directions; these include rabbits, ducks, owls, and bonus items. If a duck target crosses the bottom row without being shot, it will come to life and begin flying down toward the player. Any ducks that reach the bottom of the screen in this manner will eat some of the player's bullets. Objects also periodically appear among the targets that will give the player extra bullets or points when hit. A spinning wheel with eight pipes sits above the rows of moving targets; these pipes and all targets must be shot in order to complete the round.
At the end of each round, the player receives bonus points for all bullets remaining in his supply. He then plays a bonus round, where a large white bear with a target walks across the screen. Each time the bear is shot, it rears up for a second, then begins walking more quickly in the other direction. The object is to shoot the bear as many times as possible until it escapes off the screen. Following the bonus round, the next wave begins. Later bonus rounds add more bears to the screen.
In higher levels, there are more duck targets and fewer extra bullet targets, putting a premium on accurate shooting. The game ends when the player runs out of bullets."

"Centipede","","NTSC-U","United States of America","Atari, Inc.","Atari","1981-06-06","2","No","Action | Shooter","E - Everyone","Centipede is a 1981 arcade video game developed and released by Atari in the USA on June 6, 1981.

The player controls the small insect-like creature called the Bug Blaster. It is moved around the bottom area of the screen with a trackball and fires small darts at a segmented centipede advancing from the top of the screen through a field of mushrooms. Each segment of the centipede becomes a mushroom when shot; shooting one of the middle segments splits the centipede into two pieces at that point. Each piece then continues independently on its way down the screen, with the rear piece sprouting its own head. If the centipede head is destroyed, the segment behind it becomes the next head. Shooting the head is worth 100 points while the other segments are 10. The centipede starts at the top of the screen, traveling either left or right. When it touches a mushroom or reaches the edge of the screen, it descends one level and reverses direction. The player can destroy mushrooms (a point each) by shooting them, but each takes four shots to destroy. At higher levels, the screen can become increasingly crowded with mushrooms due to player/enemy actions, causing the centipede to descend more rapidly.

Once the centipede reaches the bottom of the screen, it stays within the player area and one-segment ""head"" centipedes will periodically appear from the side. This continues until the player has eliminated both the original centipede and all heads. When all the centipede's segments are destroyed, another one enters from the top of the screen. The initial centipede is 10 or 12 segments long, including the head; each successive centipede is one segment shorter and accompanied by one detached, faster-moving head. This pattern continues until all segments are separate heads, after which it repeats with a single full-length centipede.

The player also encounters other creatures besides the centipedes. Fleas drop vertically and disappear upon touching the bottom of the screen, occasionally leaving a trail of mushrooms in their path when only a few mushrooms are in the player movement area; they are worth 200 points each and take two shots to destroy. Spiders move across the player area in a zig-zag pattern and eat some of the mushrooms; they are worth 300, 600, or 900 points depending on the range they are shot from. Scorpions move horizontally across the screen, turning every mushroom they touch into poison mushrooms. Scorpions are also worth the most points of all enemies with 1,000 points each. A centipede touching a poison mushroom will attack straight down toward the bottom, then return to normal behavior upon reaching it. This ""poisoned"" centipede can be both beneficial and detrimental to the player; the player can destroy them rapidly as it descends down, while at the same time, they can be very challenging to avoid, especially if already split into multiple segments.

The Bug Blaster is destroyed when hit by any enemy, after which any poisonous or partially damaged mushrooms revert to normal. 5 points are awarded for each regenerated mushroom. An extra life is awarded every 12,000 points."

An adaptation of an obscure Russian DOS game called Drop-Drop, Chain Reaction is known for its cute art style (with characters based on tarot cards) and two-player competitive gameplay. Players control a little clown at the bottom of their playfields and try to arrange groups of tiles to make them disappear before a tile reaches past the bottom of the playfield. This is done by pulling down similar tiles (and throwing them back up) to match.

The game includes two game modes: the one-player score-based Solo Play (where additional lines of tiles regularly drop from the top of the screen) and two-player competitive Battle Mode (where the second player can be human or CPU opponents). Similar to Tetris Attack, players can make ""chain reactions"" by quickly creating near-simultaneous matches to either boost their score (in Solo Play) or fill up more of their opponent's playfield (in Battle Mode)."

Furthermore, a walking car or robot creature like the AT-ATs of Star Wars sometimes enter the screen, giving you bonus points if you locate your ship below it.

Each level also has a number of bombs placed at various points; the chameleon can hit these with its tongue to send them crashing towards nearby chickens. The player must keep an eye out for projectiles thrown by the chickens, such as flashing eggs.

If the nesting eggs are left for too long, they will hatch into a baby chick. The player can eat the chick for bonus points, but if the chick is left alone for too long, it will grow into an adult chicken and start attacking the player.

Its most distinctive feature is that the screen constantly auto-scrolls to the right and the protagonist runs forward automatically, except during boss fights.

Atomic Runner's base gameplay is similar to Contra, with weapon power-ups and limited platforming elements, though the automatic scrolling and near-constant forward movement also calls to mind shoot-em-ups like R-Type.

While the player character runs automatically and cannot move backward, he is able to jump, stop briefly, run faster, or turn around and run backwards in order to shoot behind him.

The game's protagonist, Chelnov, starts out as a scientist working happily alongside his father and sister. One day, his father is mortally wounded by an explosion in their home. As he dies, he reveals to Chelnov that the Deathtarians, a race claiming to have lived on Earth before humans, are responsible for the blast and have also kidnapped Chelnov's sister Chelmi.

"Cliff Hanger","","Region Not Set","","Stern Electronics, Inc.","Stern","1983-01-01","1","No","Action","E - Everyone","Cliff Hanger is a laserdisc video game that was released by Stern Electronics in 1983. It used animation from Lupin III films, mostly from The Castle of Cagliostro and a couple of scenes from The Mystery of Mamo. Like many laserdisc games, it was a reactive game which required the player to press a button or move the joystick in a particular direction when prompted by the game to progress the storyline. The segments from The Mystery of Mamo use the original English dub commissioned by Toho, while the segments from The Castle of Cagliostro use a dub created for the game.

The game's plot is based very loosely on that of The Castle of Cagliostro, and follows Cliff (Arsène Lupin III) as he attempts to rescue Clarissa (Lady Clarisse d'Cagliostro) from the evil Count Draco (in some materials called ""Dreyco"" and in the instruction manual ""Dragoe""), who wants to marry her. Cliff is aided in his quest by Jeff (Daisuke Jigen) and Samurai (Goemon Ishikawa XIII).

The original version of Cliff Hanger had an animated sequence of Cliff being hanged at the gallows immediately following the ""miss"" animation sequence. The sequence was taken from the opening sequence of The Mystery of Mamo (where Lupin was supposedly hanged in Transylvania), plus a later scene in the same film. According to the instruction manual, a setting on the game cabinet's logic board would allow the individual owners/operators the option of not playing the sequence if they so chose.

Cliff Hanger was released as the novelty of laserdisc games waned, thus many cabinets were destroyed or converted over time. Unlike other laserdisc arcade games, Cliff Hanger can work perfectly on MAME as well as DAPHNE, a laserdisc-game emulator.

The game was considered for inclusion on the American Blu-ray release of The Castle of Cagliostro by Discotek Media, however, due to an inability to find the original contracts for the game, it was left off the release."

Players control a gun at the bottom of the screen that shoots at aliens (which are known as ""chiefs"", ""guards"", ""commanders"", or ""soldiers"") that are in a formation overhead. Aliens begin peeling off the formation and fly towards the bottom of the screen while dropping bombs. There are two flagship-type aliens (chiefs) at the top of the screen that can fly accompanied with one or more escort (guard) aliens; shooting one or more of the guards before shooting a chief will increase the amount of the chief’s score. If a player does not shoot an alien (or if it doesn’t ram the player’s gun) during its attack run it will return to the formation.

There are a few differences with Galaxian, as sometimes aliens will return to the formation without dropping below the bottom of the screen (and then reappearing at the top). They also can shoot off a wide horizontal string of bombs, rather than individual shots like on Galaxian. If the last alien on a level (known as ""screens"") is left alone long enough, it will turn into a big winged creature. Also, aliens start changing form: by the third screen, they start resembling winged demons once they leave the formation, plus the player’s gun is bumped up a notch, giving them less time to react to the aliens’ attacks.

Players start off with three guns, which can be lost by being hit by an alien or bomb and the game will end if there are no more guns in reserve. An extra gun is awarded at 5,000 points."

The player can collect the gem stones scattered through the maze to gain points. Because some enemies eat gems, players can earn bonus points for collecting the last gem on the board. Other items appear, such as pots of honey, that give bonus points. Different enemies follow unique patterns, such as trees who try to find the quickest path to Bentley and are stunned briefly if Bentley jumps over them. The Gem Eaters can be defeated if Bentley runs into them while a gem stone is rising up through their body. Each level has four waves; the fourth one features Berthilda the Witch, whom Bentley can defeat when he wears the magic hat located in the maze. The hat otherwise makes Bentley briefly invincible to enemies. In the game's ending, the players receive a congratulatory message and ranking based on how many lives they have and a bonus score based on how fast they played, followed by an animation that reproduces animated rectangles."

The game replaced the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from ""cool"" to ""warm"", ""hot"", and ""critical"" status as it is used. Players can only defuse the ball, resetting it from its current state back to ""cool"" by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession, whether through touchdown, interception or fumble. A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball. The robots also possess finite durability. As offensive units are tackled, they wear down, finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits. A flaming robot will explode when hit, thereby fumbling the ball. Players can upgrade robots with faster and more durable units using money bonuses they earn during play. Players select from run, pass or option plays on offense, after which the computer presents four individual plays from which to choose. On defense, a player can select short, medium or long defenses, and then select a specific defensive scheme.

The standard Cyberball cabinet consists of two monitors, each with two sets of controls for a maximum of four players, but Atari Games released single player and two player versions as well.

The standard configuration allows single player, two player cooperative, two player head-to-head or four player head-to-head play. Playing with two teams of two persons opened up a new dimension of gameplay. Computer controlled avatars ran offensive patterns in very specific ways before reaching their assigned passing spots. Human players, however, could exploit the fact that a number of offensive plays started with identical formations. By choosing one play, but moving their avatars in imitation of a similar but different play, the offensive team could disguise their intentions before suddenly breaking for their assigned pass locations. This offensive flexibility forced defending players to quickly recognize plays and move to break them up by rushing to what they guessed was the intended passing spot. Most often, the timely use of the defender's turbo, a short-term speed boost usable once per play, would determine whether the play resulted in a missed pass, an interception, a long gain, or a score. This ability to improvise in four player mode built the popularity of Cyberball, leading to many tournaments across the United States for a period of time.

Cyberball was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992 by Jaleco. Tengen intended to release it unlicensed, but Jaleco purchased rights to publish it first. It has also been ported to other platforms, including the Commodore Amiga and Sega Genesis."

The game was largely expanded upon and rereleased in 2011 as Dariusburst: Another Chronicle EX. It was later included as a extra mode in Dariusburst Chronicle Saviours.

Plot
1904 D.C. (Darius Calendar)— When a Belser virus rent the hyperspace network to tatters, every craft in the human space fleet with a network link was stripped of all communications capabilities. The ensuing chaos saw the entire fleet devastated in the blink of an eye. The Silver Hawk fighters were the only craft from Planet Darius to escape the massacre. Equipped with Burst technology, these two cutting-edge craft were entrusted to humanoid AI terminal Ti2 and test pilot Riga Pratica. Flying the Silver Hawk Burst fighters alone into enemy territory without network support, the two heroes braved overwhelming odds to secure victory and liberation for Darius.

It is now 1910 D.C., and repairs on the hyperspace network have begun to reconnect the pockets of humanity scattered across the vast reaches of space. Combat data transmitted from Darius soon sees Burst-equipped Silver Hawk fighters constructed in every inhabited galaxy. The stage is set for mankind’s grand counteroffensive. A team of heroes takes wing, flying into battle and the pages of history.

Gameplay
The game allows from 1 and up to 4 players to play at a time; the largest amount of players possible in any Darius game. The players may choose between playing Default Entry, with 3 ships per coin, or Infinite Ships Entry, with infinite ships at the cost of additional coins and forfeit of the players' highscore.

Taking place in a medieval fantasy world obviously inspired by Dungeons and Dragons (even more so than the earlier similar games), each of the players fill a familiar role-playing archetype, illustrated via character sheets in the introduction. 
Carl F. Graystone is the knight, slow but wielding a powerful morning star, which is swung around in a circle. Freya Edirne is the wizard, subverting expectations by not being a bearded old guy but rather a woman who dresses in Egyptian-style garb. She wields a ""flame pillar"", which shoots blazes of fire along the ground.

Riger Hawk is a bard, which one would think would be useless in an action game, but he holds his own thanks to a weapon called an ""elastic spetum"", which is a sort of multi-headed spear that fires out shadow duplicates of itself. As a bonus, he's also immune to poison. Finally, there's Kirikaze the ninja, who attacks with shurikens.

The levels are presented with an isometric perspective, though your character can move in all eight directions. There are treasure chests everywhere, which grant assorted items. Most are just for score, but some can temporarily improve your speed, strength, or defense. There's also a magic meter, which slowly grows as you dispose of enemies. All of the characters can actually wield magic, not just the wizard, though the spells they're able to use are different. These are indicated by the book above the magic meter, which flips through the spell pages automatically, so you need to wait until it brings up the magic you want to use."

Just like before, the game has three courses – a Beginner course with 8 laps, an Advanced course with 4 laps, and a long Expert course with 2 laps. The 'time lap' mode also returns, and is accessed in the same manner – by holding down start at the transmission select screen. Like the original game, mirrored versions of the tracks can also be played by holding down the Start button when selecting the course. It is recommended, however, that the player has had mastery of the course beforehand. By request, an arcade operator could put the game on Grand Prix or Endurance mode to increase the number of laps in a game. Finishing a race in the top 3 in any course allows the player to view an ""ending"" and see the game credits."

Defender is set on the surface of an unnamed planet. The player controls a spaceship flying either to the left or right. A joystick controls the ship's elevation, and five buttons control its horizontal direction and weapons. The player starts with three ""smart bombs"", which destroy all visible enemies. As a last resort, the ""hyperspace"" button works as in Asteroids: the player's ship reappears in a random—possibly unsafe—location. Players are allotted three ships at the start of the game; another ship and smart bomb are awarded every 10,000 points (adjustable per machine). Two players can alternate turns.

The object is to destroy all alien invaders, while protecting astronauts on the landscape from abduction. Landers pick up humans and attempt to carry them to the top of the screen at which point they turn into fast-moving mutants. A captured human can be freed by shooting the lander, then catching the human before it falls to its death, and dropping it off on the ground.

Defeating the aliens allows the player to progress to the next level. Failing to protect the astronauts, however, causes the planet to explode and the level to become populated with mutants. Surviving the waves of mutants results in the restoration of the planet. A ship is lost if it is hit by an enemy or its projectiles, or if a hyperspace jump goes wrong (as they randomly do). After exhausting all ships, the game ends."

This game is multi-regional, meaning that it can be configured for different regions via the DIP switches. These settings change the legal warnings, can display the Taito licensing message and can change the title between the English version (Demon's World) and the Japanese version (Horror Story).

Demon's World is a horror-themed horizontally-scrolling run and gun game where players assume the role of two ghost hunters through ten increasingly difficult linear autoscrolling stages across various locations, some of which have a boss at the end that must be fought before progressing any further in an effort to defeat several ghosts and monsters that were unleashed upon Earth by the titular demon king as the main objective.

The player characters are armed with a gun complete with energy pack reminiscent to the Ghostbusters franchise to shoot various ghosts and monsters that infest each stage, though players can also defeat enemies by jumping on them, in addition of performing a double jump to move across platforms as well. Along the way, players can collect multiple a weapon power-up to change their gun to fire lasers, bombs or a spread shot. Other items can also be collected during gameplay such as ""P"" icons that, after collecting three icons in a row, grants the players a shield that takes an extra enemy hit and heart icons that gives points. Firing on determined locations is crucial to reach high-scores and get extra lives, as certain setpieces in some stages hosts bonus secrets.

The opening stages of the title take place in an eastern setting, featuring various spirits and creatures of Japanese folklore. Some of these include ghostly karakasa, chochinobake, kappa, hitotsume-kozou and rokurokubi. The game then changes course, moving to a ghostly pirate ship and then the haunted American Old West, featuring a ghost town and a canyon inhabited by traditional ghosts and monsters from western culture such as Frankenstein's monster, Dracula, and even Jason Voorhees-style masked monsters. The game's final stretch takes place in a medieval setting complete with cursed castles and dungeons infested with haunted armor, goblins and dragons.

Demon's World uses a checkpoint in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying. Getting hit by enemy fire, colliding against certain stage obstacles, falling off the stage or running against any enemy will result in losing a live and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. Although there is an ending, the game loops back to the first stage after completing the last stage as with previous titles from Toaplan, with each one increasing the difficulty."

The Super Famicom release is Japan-only. A sequel, Guardians, was released in 1995.

Denjinmakai can be played by up to two players simultaneously.[1] Health gauges are displayed for both player and enemy characters, while energy bars are displayed for special moves.

The controls consist of an eight-way joystick and two buttons for attacking and jumping respectively. Pressing the attack button repeatedly when attacking an enemy or multiple enemies will cause the player character to perform a combo. The final blow of the combo can be changed to a throw if the player moves the joystick in the opposite direction just before landing it. The player also can perform a jump attack. When two players play, they can perform team-based special moves.

Enemies can be grabbed simply by walking into one of them. When an enemy is grabbed, the player can perform a grab attack by pressing the attack button or perform a throw by tilting the joystick left or right. A thrown enemy can be tossed at another for additional damage. Items such as weapons, health recovery items, and items awarding extra points can be picked up by standing over one and pressing the attack button. Weapons have limited uses and will disappear if the player is disarmed by an enemy too much or when the player moves to a new area.

In the home version, only three (Makai, Iyo, and Belva) out of the six characters are playable,[1] and the other three (Kurokishi, Zeldia, and Tulks) were turned into bosses; one stage was also removed.

By removing blocks of the same type, the player eliminates them. In the game's story, the daruma/dharma dolls and colored blocks are summoned by oni to terrorize the populace, and it's down to the player character (the player can choose from a male and a female character) to remove them.

Dharma Doujou was released to the Arcade in 1994 and ported to the Super Famicom the following year.

The game board is comprised of various stacks of circular colored blocks, like the ones commonly seen underneath daruma/dharma dolls. The player character can rise and drop via a magic cloud, allowing them to sit parallel with any stack. By hitting a block stack, the one furthest from the player - to the far left - falls through a gutter that runs down the left side. The other blocks fill the gaps left behind, each moving one space to the left.

If the player knocks five blocks of the same type through, they vanish off the grid and allows the player to survive a little longer. Five mismatched blocks will appear as the new bottom row, pushing everything above it up one block, though this is sometimes necessary to line up the next five matching blocks.

Players fight their way through waves of enemies, using their fists, feet, and a variety of weapons that can be collected from enemies or the environment, from household items such as brooms and pepper shakers to high-damage missile launchers and anti-tank cannons. Most weapons are automatically lost at the end of each action scene, but hand guns can be retained so long as they have ammunition remaining. The typical level structure is a number of minions the player must defeat in many rooms, followed by a boss. Bosses can be anything from human minions of White Fang to spider robots. Quick Time Events are interspersed between many of the scenes. In these events, the player(s) may be running and turning a corner and they face an enemy, so they must perform a designated command to avoid being injured or to help defeat an enemy. In some cases failing a Quick Time Event will result in loss of health, as is usual for QTEs, but failing most will put the player characters into an additional action scene which they otherwise would not have to complete. Cutscenes are interspersed into the action."
"Diet Go Go","","Region Not Set","","Data East Corporation","Data East Corporation","1992-03-11","2","Yes","Strategy | Platform","","Think of a cross between Bubble Bobble, Snow Bros and Rod-Land and you might, just might get an insight into the sheer lunacy that was Data East’s Diet Go Go.

Like many other single screen platformers of the time, the aim of the game was relatively simple: clear all the enemies from each stage and pick up any goodies that they left behind. Unlike its peers though, Diet Go Go placed you in the lycra-cladded bodysuits of two Japanese teenagers who were desperately trying to avoid putting on weight.

The outrageously cute duo would jump around the screen and bombard their foes with what looked like small pink apples. When an enemy was hit, it would immediately start expanding in size and would slowly begin to rise to the top of the screen. Jump into it and the deflated foe would zoom around the level taking out any monsters that were foolish enough to get in its way.

Of course, your numerous foes – many of which were nauseatingly cute – were far from defenceless and would bombard you with a variety of food. Should any of it hit you, your cute teen would immediately gain weight and lose a considerable amount of speed; getting hit again would cause you to lose one of your three lives. Enemies could still kill you with a single touch though, so it was always best to avoid them all together – although this in itself was far from easy due to the sheer number of them on-screen.

Eventually you’d reach an extremely memorable boss that often came equipped with a variety of interesting attacks. An oversized crab, cute vampire and a giant wooden marionette were just a few of the highlights, but many more wackier foes lay in wait, providing of course that you were skilled enough to reach them.Diet Go Go may not have been a well-known arcade game and we’ve never seen a home conversion of it, but that’s just made the experience of playing it all the more sweeter for us."

Dig Dug II is the sequel to the 1982 arcade video game, Dig Dug.

The player controls Taizo Hori (he was known as Dig Dug when the game was released) from the previous game and must wipe out the enemies on the island. A level is cleared when all of the enemies are defeated.

The biggest difference is that the game is an overhead view on an island, and requires Taizo to destroy the island and defeat the enemies (rather than digging underground). Because of this, Taizo cannot use rocks to defeat enemies.

Taizo has two weapons in this game, a jackhammer and his air pump. The pump can be used to inflate the enemies until they pop, while the jackhammer can be drilled into faults. When the faults connect to the edge or any other faults, the entire section on the island will crumble into the water. Taizo can clear large amounts of enemies this way, but he can fall into the water as well.

The Pooka and Fygar enemies return and the Fygars can still shoot fire out of their mouths at Taizo. The player loses a life if he collides with it. The enemies can phase through the fault lines to get to another area (mostly where the player is)."

The game was also released in the People's Republic of China, which was unveiled at the GTI Asia China Expo. The game's main track played throughout the menu is More Human than Human by White Zombie.

Gameplay

In Dirty Drivin', players engage in vehicular combat, and gear-shaped power-ups are available throughout the track, which can be used to destroy enemy vehicles by pulling a skull-shaped crank, which do not return to the race after getting destroyed; exceptions to this are the player and their rival, a single AI opponent, as well as other players when playing in multiplayer. Players can also jerk the wheel to hit opponents, and whenever an opponent gets destroyed, a photo of the opponent appears at the bottom of the screen, as well as a taunt. Points that the player earns increases the amount of weapons available to the player on the ""Jerk-O-Meter"". Also scattered throughout the track are crates, which can increase the player's points, double dirty on the power-ups, or give the player a free race.

After every race, a slot machine-style game is played called ""Yank the Crank"", where the player is to pull the skull crank, in an attempt to earn items that can be used in the next race (but will be lost if the player leaves the game), as well as a free race, though players can also get a ""You Lose"", which not only leaves them empty handed, but also logs them out of the game.

The game has a password system, where players enter a PIN to save their progress.

Development

Development for Dirty Drivin' started in 2009, and was originally designed by Specular Interactive as ""H2Overdrive on wheels"", and the prototype cabinet for the game was a modified H2Overdrive unit with pedals and a slot machine crank. On the cabinet, gauges depict the situation that the player is in (though the developers originally intended to use automobile gauges)."

"Do! Run Run","","NTSC-U","United States of America","Universal U.S.A., Inc.","Universal Entertainment Corporation","1984-11-01","2","No","Action","E - Everyone","Do! Run Run is a 1984 arcade video game developed by Universal and released by Universal USA in the USA on November 1, 1984.

Do! Run Run is the fourth and final video game in the Mr. Do! series.

The goal of Do! Run Run is to rack up points while completing screens. A screen is completed whenever all the fruits/dots are eaten, or when all of the regular monsters (not Alpha-monsters or their sidekicks) are defeated. Using the rope that follows Mr. Do to inscribe dots will convert them into cherries, a familiar fruit for Mr. Do to collect. Cherries are worth more points than dots, and eating them restores the powerball more quickly than eating dots would. Each time Mr. Do inscribes fruit, they progress to a higher tier, dots become cherries, cherries become apples, apples become lemons and lemons become pineapples. Eating a dot awards 10 points and 1/16 of a powerball recharge; eating a pineapple is worth 160 points and 1/4 of a powerball recharge.

Players are additionally encouraged to inscribe sections of the playfield by the letters E, X, T, R, A, a constant feature of the Mr. Do! games. Randomly, one of the inscribed fruits will turn into a flashing letter spot, corresponding with the movement of the Alpha-Monster at the top of the screen. If Mr. Do! runs over this spot, the monster sporting that letter will release from the top of the screen with three blue henchmen (which resemble the three ghost-like monsters from the original Mr. Do!, and chase after Mr. Do. Defeating the Alpha-monster will lock in that letter, and once all 5 letters are earned, the player earns an extra life (as well as progressing to the next stage, you also earn a 5,000 point bonus).

Points are also awarded for defeating monsters. Directly firing the powerball at a monster awards 500 points and consumes the powerball, which needs to be replenished by eating fruit. More points are earned if the powerball bounces off of a surface; each bounce raises the bonus by 500 points until a maximum of 3000 points are earned. Smashing monsters with a rolling log earns 1000 points; it is possible to roll over multiple monsters and earn a cumulative bonus of 500 per extra monster (so, 1500 for the 2nd, 2000 for the 3rd, etc.). Apparently there is a 10,000 point bonus for smashing 5 monsters.

Monsters
Like other Mr. Do! games, the monsters are nameless (except Alpha-monsters) and defy easy description. Two types of monsters attempt to foil the clown's efforts, a green clam-like monster, and a blue snake-like monster. Neither are particularly sophisticated, although the clam monsters have some seemingly clever moments where they bumble into your path or out of the way of the powerball. The blue snakes will, if you linger too long on a direct path from them, convert into a fireball and charge across the playing field. In this state, they are immune to the powerball. As is common with arcade games, contact with monsters is instantly fatal, with Mr. Do shown to be electrocuted, complete with visible flashing skeleton, and then reappearing as a black skeleton.

After some time on each stage elapses, the music changes and any surviving monsters convert into a different form; the clam monsters become blue and armored with spines, the snake monsters essentially become different looking snake monsters. The speed of each monster, and the willingness to chase Mr. Do, are about the only other major changes; they can be fairly easily eluded so long as the player does not simply run away from them. Instead, Mr. Do should climb up or down the terrain if too closely chased; monsters lose a lot of time changing levels on the playfield whereas Mr. Do gets a slight speed up for going downslope. After a short duration, the music resumes, and the monsters transform back into their old selves, with the pattern of transformation repeating.

Alpha-monsters, when they are summoned by the letter circle, are released with three henchmen. The henchmen home in on Mr. Do! and typically precede the alpha-monster. Killing the Alpha-monster rids the playfield of the henchmen, although it is easier to lure all four into the path of a log and smash them. Alpha-monsters are also released every time the score reaches increments of 5,000 points unless there is already an alpha-monster on the playfield.

Free Games
While this can be configured by the ROM to not occur, infrequently, a bonus diamond worth 10,000 points will show up in the same manner as the letter circles when fruit are inscribed. If the player collects this, the stage ends and they are awarded a bonus credit in the fashion of the original Mr. Do!."

"DoDonPachi Dai-Ou-Jou Black Label","","Region Not Set","","AMI Co., Ltd.","CAVE Co., Ltd.","2002-10-25","2","Yes","Shooter","","Shortly after the arcade release of dodonpachi Dai-Ou-Jou, CAVE released dodonpachi Dai-Ou-Jou Black Label (which also contains the original version of Dai-Ou-Jou. You select which version to play as it boots up). It was purportedly released due to a small number of complaints from high-level arcade players regarding the original version of Dai-Ou-Jou.

The most common complaint was that Dai-Ou-Jou confiscated any spare lives you had at the end of the first loop, thus forcing you to begin the more difficult second loop starting with 1 life only. In dodonpachi Dai-Ou-Jou Black Label, any extra lives you have by the end of the first loop will be carried over to the second loop.

Another complaint was that while you can credit-feed through the second loop if you reach it, the game automatically ends once you lose your last life on stage 2-5. After clearing stage 2-5, you fight the secret boss Hibachi, who is one of the most difficult bosses to feature in a shmup. So this made practicing patterns on Hibachi very difficult as it would mean reaching 2-5 with a decent number of lives in stock. Apparently only 5 players were known to have beat Hibachi 12 months after Dai-Ou-Jou's arcade release - so this may have been a key complaint.

For Dodonpachi Dai-Ou-Jou Black Label, you select 1 Loop Mode or 2 Loop Mode at the beginning, after selecting your ship. 2 Loop Mode is the normal arcade play with both loops (and as with the original Dai-Ou-Jou, after clearing the 1-5 boss, you have the option to continue into the second loop, or call it a day). With 1 Loop Mode, after defeating the 1-5 boss, you reach the Hibachi fight, which you can also now credit-feed through. So this makes practicing Hibachi much more feasable than what would be needed in the original Dai-Ou-Jou.

There are other small subtle changes as well. The common perception is that the Hyper Meter fills faster in Black Label, but actually there are small nuances in the original that result in the Hyper Meter not always filling as it should, which have been addressed in Black Label. Some bosses also have altered patterns in the second loop. The chain meter now has 5 digits, so it won't roll-over if it reaches 9999 hits (specifically the stage 4 boss fight).

As Hyper items are generated quicker in Black Label, the increase in difficulty once activated is marginally less. Both versions of Dai-Ou-Jou have two different rank systems constantly in effect, Basic Rank (raises with no deaths and maximum bombs) and Shot-Speed Rank (raises with Hyper activation). Because spare lives are carried over into the second loop in Black Label, the Basic Rank will be higher than the normal verson of Dai-Ou-Jou. The result is that Black Label has a marginally easier first loop, and a marginally more difficult second loop, providing a more balanced game.

CAVE protected the Black Label PCB with a suicide battery. See the hardware page for details. In addition the game had a low print-run (rumoured to be approximately 100 copies) and therefore became quite collectable amongst arcade hobbyists.

The differences between the normal version of Dai-Ou-Jou and Dai-Ou-Jou Black Label are small and not immediately noticable. The differences are all in place to benefit high level play, particularly players who wish to attack the second loop. So many of the changes may not be of much significance to western players, ie players who cannot clear the first loop, or no-miss no-bomb many levels. But if you dig deep into Dai-Ou-Jou, and really wish to persevere with the game, Black Label offers more balance, a better learning curve, and a more accessable second loop.

During a match, the player has the option to ask for help. After making a request the player may either ask for the best place to play in this turn, or go back one turn. But your opponent also has the opportunity to go back one turn as well. If a round is played to completion, the pieces are counted and whoever has the most pieces wins. If the player loses then it is game over. If the player continues then the round starts over. If the player wins, then the opponent strips for the player. Strip sequences consist of the girl shown in a still pose, with her clothing disappearing off of her until she is left wearing just a bikini. Each girl has just one strip sequence before the player continues on to the next opponent."

Donkey Kong is the first game in the Donkey Kong series.

As the first platformer video game, Donkey Kong requires the player to jump between gaps and over obstacles or approaching enemies, setting the template for the future of the genre. With four unique stages, Donkey Kong was the most complex arcade game of the time, and one of the first arcade games with multiple stages, following games such as Phoenix (1980), Gorf (1981), and Scramble (1981).

In addition to the goal of saving Pauline, the player has a score. Points are awarded for the following: leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer power-up; collecting items such as hats, parasols, and purses; removing rivets from platforms; and completing each stage according to a steadily decreasing bonus counter. The player starts with three lives with a bonus life awarded at 7,000 points. A life is lost when Mario touches Donkey Kong or any enemy object, falls too far, or lets the bonus counter reach zero. The game ends when all lives are lost.

Each of the four single-screen stages represents 25 meters of the structure Donkey Kong has climbed: 25, 50, 75, and 100 meters. Stage one involves Mario scaling a construction site made of crooked girders and ladders while jumping over or hammering barrels and oil drums tossed by Donkey Kong. Stage two involves climbing a five-story structure of conveyor belts, each of which transport cement pans. The third stage involves the player riding elevators while avoiding bouncing springs. The final stage requires Mario to remove eight rivets from the platforms supporting Donkey Kong; this causes Donkey Kong to fall and the hero to be reunited with Pauline. These four stages combine to form one level.

After each level, the stages repeat with increased difficulty. For example, Donkey Kong begins to hurl barrels faster and sometimes diagonally, and fireballs speed up. The victory music alternates between levels 1 and 2. The fourth level consists of five stages with the final stage at 125 meters. Level 130 is colloquially known as the kill screen, due to a programming error that kills Mario after a few seconds, effectively ending the game."

Donkey Kong 3 is the third and final game in the Donkey Kong series.

Donkey Kong hangs from vines at the center of the screen, and the player-controlled Stanley the exterminator runs and jumps on platforms beneath him. Stanley can fire bug spray at both Donkey Kong and insects flying around the levels. A level is completed by continually using his sprayer on Donkey Kong, forcing him to the top of the screen, or by killing all of the bugs. A Super Sprayer can on the vines falls down when Donkey Kong is sprayed past it. The Super Sprayer only lasts for a limited amount of time, but it pushes Donkey Kong upward at a much faster rate, making it easier to complete the level. It only spawns at the start of each life.

The insects consist of Buzzbees, queen Beespies (which shatter into deadly pieces when destroyed), Creepy inchworms, Attacker bees, Kabutomushi beetles, and Butterflies. Some of the flying insects attempt to pick up the flowers at the bottom of the screen and carry them away. Lost flowers decrease the bonus at the end of the round.

There are three levels which repeat in a fixed sequence. An extra life is given at 50,000 points, and then the game goes to ""survival of the fittest"" mode thereafter."

It is a homebrew game having no affiliation with Nintendo and can be applied as a chip update to a Donkey Kong PCB. Adding the DK2 chipset allows you to switch from original Donkey Kong to DK2 via pressing both Player Start buttons followed by the Jump button.

The modded game offers a total of 8 levels. This includes the original 4 levels, with a few minor (clever) updates, and 4 new levels: Mixer, Foundry, Refinery, and Incinerator. I love the chip-swap implementation making this upgrade fairly easy for most owners. But what astounds me most is the visual integration of the 4 new levels!

After playing the original Donkey Kong, both Donkey Kong Junior and Donkey Kong 3 look and play much differently as though they are tied in primarily by title. Jeff's Donkey Kong II Jumpman Returns seems to flow seamlessly from the original. Partly due to including the original's 4 levels, but the design and play makes it feel like a Nintendo sequel. Without being told, I wouldn't have guessed it was a homebrew created decades after the original."

Donkey Kong Junior is the second game in the Donkey Kong series.

There are a total of four stages, each with a unique theme. DK Jr. can run left and right, jump, and grab vines/chains/ropes to climb higher on the screen. He can slide down faster by holding only one vine, or climb faster by holding two. Enemies include ""Snapjaws"", which resemble bear traps with eyes; bird-like creatures called ""Nitpickers"", some of which can attack by dropping eggs; and ""Sparks"" which roam across the wiring in one of Mario's hideouts. DK Jr. can jump over these enemies while on platforms, switch from one vine/chain/rope to another to dodge them, or knock down pieces of fruit that will destroy every enemy they touch before falling off the bottom of the screen.

To pass the first three stages, DK Jr. must reach the key hanging next to his father's cage, whereupon Mario flees while pushing the cage off the screen. In the fourth stage, DK Jr. must push six keys into locks on the topmost platform to free Donkey Kong. After a brief cutscene, the player is taken back to the first stage at an increased difficulty. A bonus timer runs throughout each stage, and any points remaining on it are added to the player's score upon completion.

DK Jr. loses a life when he touches any enemy or projectile, falls too great a distance, touches the water and falls off the bottom of the screen or if the bonus timer counts down to zero. The game ends when the player loses all of their lives."

This area is populated by viruses of three colors: red, yellow, and blue. In a manner and style considered similar to Tetris,[14] the player manipulates each capsule as it falls, moving it left or right and rotating it such that it is positioned alongside the viruses and any existing capsules. When four or more capsule halves or viruses of matching color are aligned in vertical or horizontal configurations, they are removed from play. The main objective is to complete levels, which is accomplished by eliminating all viruses from the playing field. A game over occurs if capsules fill up the playing field in a way that obstructs the bottle's narrow neck.[15]

Players can select the degree of starting difficulty any time a new game is started. The initial level chosen is a value between zero and twenty that determines the number of viruses to clear, and the three game speed options change how fast the capsules fall in the bottle. The player's score is based solely on the elimination of viruses, not on the time taken to complete the level or the number of capsules used. If players complete the highest difficulty level, they can continue playing to accumulate a higher score, but the number of viruses to clear remains the same. Additional points are awarded when multiple viruses are eliminated at once, but no additional points are awarded for initiating chain reactions, in which the elimination of one set of objects triggers the elimination of another set. The game speed is also a factor in how the game calculates scoring; higher speed levels yield more points."

Most other games of the era represented the character as a sprite, which consisted of a series of pixels displayed in succession. Due to hardware limitations of the era, artists were greatly restricted in the detail they could achieve using that technique; the resolution, framerate and number of frames were severely constrained. Dragon's Lair overcame those limitations by tapping into the vast storage potential of the LaserDisc, but imposed other limitations on the actual gameplay.

Whilst similar, they are different games, and we’ll look at SNK’s game in a later post, but both are pretty similar to the first game except for one big difference – instead of the direct overhead view used before, Visco Corp have instead shifted the perspective to an angled overhead one.
Aside from the change in viewpoint there’s actually very little difference between the games though. There’s a similar roster of cars available here (although it seems Visco acquired an official license in the interim as the cars all have their proper names now), such as the usual Impreza, Evo, Celica, Lancia’s, etc. Sadly the Sierra doesn’t return but to make up for it they’ve included a Mini! Anyway, once you’ve chosen a car you’ll start your first race which must be completed within a set time limit. The more time you can finish inside the limit by, the better your final position will be, but if you don’t even manage to finish inside the specified time at all, the game is over! As before, you don’t start the race at the same time as your rivals but if you’re good/bad enough, you will encounter other cars on the road here and there."

"Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow Over Mystara","","Region Not Set","","Capcom","Capcom","1996-11-01","4","Yes","Role-Playing | Fighting","","In addition to the original four heroes found in its predecessor, Dungeons & Dragons: Tower of Doom (Cleric, Dwarf, Elf and Fighter), Shadow of Mystara adds a Thief and a Magic-User to the selection. Furthermore, with the inclusion of two separate versions of each character's sprite set, the game allows up to two players to select the same character (in Tower of Doom each of the characters could only be selected once), effectively giving the game 12 ""different"" characters to choose from. The two Clerics and two Magic Users also have subtle differences within their spell books.

The controls are using four buttons: Attack, Jump, Select (brings up a small inventory ring around the character allowing the player to choose what item is set in the Use slot) and Use. The Cleric, Elf and Magic-User also have two extra rings for their spells, with the Jump button used to switch from ring to ring. While the game uses the same kick harness as the previous game, the Select and Use buttons are reversed.

Shadow over Mystara also introduced a selection of special moves which are executed by moving the joystick and tapping the buttons in certain combinations, in a way similar to the Street Fighter series. The characters (except for the Magic-User) have a Dashing Attack as well as a Rising Attack which can be used to combo monsters or even juggle them in the air. Most characters (again, with the exception of the Magic-User and also Cleric) also have a Megacrush, a move common to nearly all of Capcom side-scrollers, which damages all enemies standing close enough to the character but in turn also damaging the player themselves."

Bosses include a troll that regenerates unless burned, a large black dragon, the dreaded Shadow Elf (Mystara's equivalent of the drow), a beholder, the optional superboss Flamewing (a great wyrm red dragon) and the final boss Deimos (an archlich).

At points in the game the players are presented with a choice of paths to take to continue progress. Each path goes to a different area, and it is impossible to visit every area in a single play.

The gameplay is more technical than the average on beat'em up games. In addition to the usual basic attacks and jumping it includes blocking, strong attacks, turning attacks, dashing attacks, crouching and evading. It also requires the use of careful tactics, as most enemies have the same abilities as the heroes and can out-range them, too.

Daggers, hammers, arrows and burning oils can be used as throwing weapons, and many enemies have similar weapons. Spells can be used by means of magical rings or by the two playable spellcasters (a cleric and an elf)."

The player assumes the role of Agent 17, codename: ""Otto"", a secret agent. Otto enters a 30-story building at roof level and must work his way down to the basement, collecting secret documents whose locations are marked by red doors. Along the way, he must use the building's elevator and escalator systems to move from floor to floor and avoid or kill the enemy agents trying to stop him. After picking up all the documents, Otto can escape to the basement and drive away in a waiting car to end the level. Otto can move left and right, jump, duck, and fire up to three shots at a time from his pistol. While Otto is in an elevator, the player can push up or down to send him to a higher or lower floor. He can run or jump across an empty shaft as long as the elevator is above him, and can ride on its roof but not control its motion or cross to the other side.

If Otto tries to leave the building without collecting all the documents, he will be transported to the highest floor that still has an unopened red door and must work his way back down. In addition, if he takes too long to clear a level, an alarm will sound; the enemy agents then become more aggressive, and the elevators will be slower to respond to the player's joystick movements.

Each building contains a section in which the lights are out, making it harder to see approaching enemies. On other floors, Otto can temporarily disable the lights by shooting one of the overhead fixtures. Otto is trained in shooting as well as karate. Otto can kill enemy agents by shooting them, jump-kicking them at close range, dropping a light fixture on their heads, or crushing them with an elevator.

The player must shoot their way through a series of simple maze-like levels, releasing the human hostages along the way. Levers must be found and thrown to activate the escalators which allow access to new areas. Gems can be collected to increase the power of the player's ray gun, and food lockers may be broken into for a health boost.

At the end of each level the play switches to an isometric auto-scrolling sequence in which the player controls his character in a small spaceship, and must steer left or right to navigate through a maze of obstacles. If the player reaches the end of this sequence they will progress to the next level."

At the start of the game the player selects one of three player characters, and then selects one of five girls (and one guy) as the person hidden in the bonus stage.

In each regular stage the player uses a powertool to drill away at the blocks obstructing the view of the nude girl underneath. Various enemies appear at regular intervals and must be avoided or destroyed with gunfire or bombs. Occasionally various power-ups appear that the player may collect for more fire-power or drilling power. Once 65% of the obstructing blocks have been destroyed, the background image goes from a dark, shaded image to a bright, full color image. And the level is cleared after 81% of the blocks are cleared.

After each stage the player returns to the same bonus stage. Here the player clears a wall of bricks with no enemies to hamper him. Various items and point bonuses are hidden in the wall and can be collected by the player. Again, once 65% of the blocks are cleared the image is brightened and the level is cleared after 81% of the bricks are destroyed.

Time extensions are awarded for reaching multiple checkpoints on a course, however the player will receive time penalties for falling off-course or depleting their energy meter.

Now Terry, Andy, Joe, Mai and Geese are back in South Town to battle five new characters and three bosses. All of them have their own reasons of coming to South Town, but in the end, everything links to a scroll that reveals the secret to the lost ancient martial arts.

Fatal Fury 3 was a pretty big improvement over its predecessors, introducing brand new re-drawn character sprites (yet again) and better overall animation quality. Of course, a handful of colorful new characters join the roster, in addition to some new 2D environments.

The two-plane gameplay was upgraded to a three plane format known as the Oversway System. Players fight primarily in the middle plane or the main plane, but can move or ""oversway"" into either of the sway lines at the background or foreground . Attacks between planes have returned but are now called ""Oversway Attacks"" and players can use special technique to defend these attacks. Other new gameplay elements introduced include air blocking, combination arts, new special & super moves, and even alternate (more powerful) super moves which can only be used once per round.

Along with a cool looking world map, Fatal Fury 3 also features a ranking system when fighting against the computer, which brought some innovation to the fighting genre. When the player wins a round, they'll be ranked from D to triple S. The final opponents the player faces at the end of the single player mode is determined the by the player's average... with a lower score, the game will end against Yamazaki, but with a higher score they will square off against one of the Jin twins, or possibly both. Overall, Fatal Fury 3 was easily the best presentation of the series to date."

According to game artist Yoshiki Kawasaki, Flicky is just a friend to the Chirps although some players may think she is a mother to them. The Chirps follow Flicky in a chain until they are collected at the exit. Bonus points are awarded for bringing multiple Chirps back in a single chain.

There are 48 total stages. Each stage takes place on a single wraparound screen that scrolls horizontally with Flicky always in the center. After all the stages are completed, the game loops infinitely on an increased difficulty mode.

Collected Chirps will disperse if the their chain comes in contact with an enemy.[1] Some of the chirps wear sunglasses; these chirps behave more unpredictably when dispersed.[1] There are two enemy types in the standard rounds, house cats called Tigers and green iguanas called Iggys. These enemies can be simply avoided but can also be defeated with throwable items available on some levels. These items include telephones, flower pots, cups, and bottles. Flicky can pick up an item by walking into it, and throw it by jumping. Sometimes diamonds may appear, which cannot be thrown but rather provide bonus points.[3] There are also bonus rounds in which Flicky attempts to catch as many falling Chirps as possible in a net."

The objective of the game is to guide a frog to each of the empty homes at the top of the screen. The game starts with three, five, or seven frogs, depending on the machine's settings. Losing all frogs is game over. The player uses the 4-direction joystick to hop the frog once. Frogger is either single-player or two players alternating turns.

The frog starts at the bottom of the screen, which contains a horizontal road occupied by speeding vehicles such as race cars, dune buggies, trucks, and bulldozers. The player must guide the frog between opposing lanes of traffic to avoid becoming roadkill and losing a life. After crossing the road, a median strip separates the two major parts of the screen. The upper half consists of a river with logs, alligators, and turtles, all moving horizontally across the screen in opposite directions. By jumping on swiftly moving logs and the backs of alligators and turtles, the player can guide the frog to safety. The player must avoid snakes, otters, and the open mouths of alligators. A brightly colored female frog is sometimes on a log and may be carried for bonus points. The very top of the screen contains five ""frog homes"", and at least one is always open and available. These sometimes contain bonus insects or deadly alligators.

When all five frogs are in their homes, the game progresses to the next level with increased difficulty. After five levels, the difficulty briefly eases and yet again progressively increases after each level. The timer gives 30 seconds to guide each frog into one of the homes, and resets back to 60 ticks whenever a life is lost or a frog reaches home safely.

In 1982, Softline stated that ""Frogger has earned the ominous distinction of being 'the arcade game with the most ways to die'."" There are many different ways to lose a life (illustrated by a skull and crossbones symbol where the frog was), including being run over by a road vehicle; jumping into the river; running into snakes, otters, or an alligator's jaws; sinking while on top of a diving turtle; riding a log, alligator, or turtle off the side of the screen; jumping into a home already occupied by a frog or alligator; jumping into the side of a home or the bush; or running out of time.

The opening tune is the first verse of a Japanese children's song called ""Inu No Omawarisan"" (""The Dog Policeman""). Other Japanese tunes include the themes to the anime series Hana no Ko Lunlun and Rascal the Raccoon. The American release has the same opening song plus ""Yankee Doodle"".

Scoring
Every forward step scores 10 points, and every frog arriving safely home scores 50 points. 10 points are also awarded per each unused ½ second of time. Guiding a lady frog home or eating a fly scores 200 points each, and when all 5 frogs reach home to end the level the player earns 1,000 points. A single bonus frog is given at 20,000 points. 99,990 points is the maximum high score that can be achieved on an original arcade cabinet. Players may exceed this score, but the game ""rolls over"" and only keeps the last 5 digits."

Some other features introduced in Galactic Warriors that were used in later fighting games include block damage, air-blocking, the ability to shoot/throw projectiles, the ability to execute multiple attacks while airborne, a modern health bar (as opposed to a health meter with notches like in Capcom's Mega Man series that made their debut two years later), the ability to switch between armed and unarmed and attacks of varying levels of strength.

Another feature introduced at the time allows the player to choose one of three Mechas, each with their own movesets: Samson, Gaea and Poseidon. When one is selected, the player must use it to destroy other robots in each planet. Other than the playable characters, there are several non-playable characters and bosses with original designs and unique movesets. In the final battle, the player will face the same character he or she chose. After defeating the final opponent, the game goes back to the beginning and the player's chosen character and the opponents will have an extra weapon.

Unlike in the single player modes of other fighting games, Galactic Warriors lacks continues and gives the player a number of lives similar to ones in some other genres from platform games to beat 'em ups. When the player loses all of his or her lives, the game is over and it returns to attract mode. In each battle, the timer starts at one minute and thirty seconds, and when it drops to zero before any player is knocked out, the player with the least amount of damage wins. Players can monitor this by looking at their life bars. At the start of the fight, both players life bars are blue, but as the fight progresses, the life bar changes to a pink color for the player with the least amount of health remaining or most damage taken. Therefore, if a player's life bar is pink when/if time runs out, that player will lose."

Galaga is the second game in the Galaxian series.

The player mans a lone starfighter at the bottom of the screen, which must prevent the Galaga forces from destroying all of mankind. The objective of each stage is to defeat all of the Galaga aliens, which will fly into formation from the top and sides of the screen. Similar to Galaxian, aliens will dive towards the player while shooting down projectiles; colliding with either projectiles or aliens will result in a life being lost.

Atop the enemy formation are four large aliens known as the ""Boss Galaga"", which take two shots to destroy. These aliens can use a tractor beam to capture the player's ship, returning with it to the top of the formation and costing the player a life. Should additional lives remain, the player has an opportunity to shoot down the Boss Galaga holding the captured ship. Shooting it down as it dives towards the player will result in the captured ship being rescued, and it will join the player's ship, transforming it into a ""dual-fighter"" with additional firepower and a larger hitbox. However, destroying a Boss Galaga with a captured ship while it is in formation will instead cause the fighter to turn against the player and act as an alien. The ship will return in a later level as part of the formation.

Some enemies can morph into new enemy types with different attack patterns, with one even taking the form of the Galaxian Flagship. Stages are indicated by emblems located at the bottom-right of the screen. Enemies become more aggressive as the game progresses, increasing their number of projectiles and diving down at a faster rate. The third stage and every fourth thereafter is a bonus stage, where the aliens fly in a preset formation without firing at the player."
"Galaga '88","","Region Not Set","","Namco","Namco","1987-12-01","2","No","Shooter","","The gameplay in Galaga '88 is built on the same premise as that of the original Galaga game, but is in many ways more complex and more difficult. The game is divided into a series of 29 Stages distributed through eight Worlds. The starship Galaga accelerates between Stages and Worlds and even to higher dimensions (go to the section on Dimensional Travel below to find out more).

With the exception of the third and eighth, each World culminates in a Challenging Stage. There are six such stages to engage in any full game, and each begins with the on-screen announcement ""That's Galactic Dancin'!"" and has its own YM2151-generated song to which the enemy formations dance. In any given Challenging Stage, both the design of the enemies and their dancing formations shall vary according to the player's current Dimension. As in Galaga, the objective is to destroy all forty enemies before they fly away off the screen. However, refraining completely from touching any controls for the duration of a Challenging Stage awards a ""secret bonus"" ranging in value from 10000 to 25000 points, and equal to the ""special bonus"" which would have been awarded for destroying all forty enemy aliens instead.

Galaga '88 introduces a variety of new enemies and behaviors. Most of these special enemies are worth varying amounts of bonus points when destroyed. Some enemies can combine into larger enemies which take multiple hits to destroy, while others arrive in eggs, explode in a shower of fireworks, grow with multiple hits, or sport armor which makes them invincible while in formation. Certain enemies drop small formations of tiny creatures that wiggle their way down the screen, and still others can act as escorts to incoming groups of enemies and then quickly dive at the player before leaving the game. Most stages also include various obstacles which appear once the enemy formation has been assembled. These can be destroyed with either one or several shots, and the first one on each stage will leave a ""Warp Capsule"".

At the start of the game, the player can select how many Galaga starships to start with (one or two), affecting their number of remaining lives. The game ends after the final boss is defeated (or when the player's last ship is destroyed or captured) - in the latter case, the player can continue the game for an additional credit. The Game Over screen shows the player's hit-miss ratio and a visual representation of their progress. If the player reaches Stage 27, the game also shows a picture of the final boss (damaged if defeated, but silhouetted if not). If the arcade operator has set the ""continue"" option to ""on"", the player also cannot continue if he is defeated on Stages 27-29."

The enemies appear in formation towards the top of the screen, with two escort ships, labeled the ""Galaxian Flagship"" or ""Galboss"". Enemies will make a divebomb towards the bottom of the screen while shooting projectiles in an attempt to hit the player. The Galaxip can only fire a single shot at a time, and the player must wait for it to either hit an enemy or the top of the screen before being able to fire another, due to limitations of the hardware.

Flagships will make a divebomb with two red escort ships - shooting all three of these will award the player bonus points, with extra points awarded to the destruction of the flagship. Enemy movement will increase as the game progresses alongside the number of shots that the enemies fire. Rounds are indicated by small flags at the bottom of the screen.

At the start of the game, the player may select any one of five planets:

Megaleon (Man-Made world): This is default start level. The first half consists of combat in open space, slowly approaching a fortress inside the planet. Enemies include fighter ships, with the only obstacle being an orbital construction site.
Ashutar (Volcanic world): Here, the player must traverse through two fortresses.

The game is set within a series of top-down, third-person, orthographic mazes where the object is to kill monsters, gather treasures, and find the exit in every level. An assortment of special items can be located in each level. These items can increase the player's health, unlock doors, award more points and destroy all of the enemies on screen.

Each player controls one of four playable fantasy-based characters: Thor, a warrior; Merlin, a wizard; Thyra, a valkyrie; or Questor, an Elf. The characters are named on the cabinet artwork, but in-game they are referred only by the title of their classes. Each character has his or her own unique strengths and weaknesses. For example, the warrior is strongest in hand-to-hand combat, the wizard has the most powerful magic, the valkyrie has the best armor, and the Elf is the fastest in movement. The characters are assigned by control panel in the four-player version, whereas in the two-player version each player selects their own character at the start of the game or while joining during the middle of play.

The enemies are an assortment of fantasy-based monsters, including ghosts, grunts, demons, lobbers, sorcerers, and thieves. Each enters the level through specific generators, which can be destroyed. While there are no bosses in the game, the most dangerous enemy is Death, who can only be destroyed by using a magic potion—otherwise Death will vanish automatically after it has drained a certain amount of health from the player.

As the game progresses, higher levels of skill are needed to reach the exit, with success often depending on the willingness of the players to cooperate by sharing food and luring monsters into places where they can be engaged and slaughtered more conveniently. While contact with enemies reduces the player's health, health also slowly drains on its own, thus creating a time limit. When a character's health reaches zero, that character dies. The character can be revived in place with full health by spending a game credit—inserting a coin in the arcade—within a certain short time window after it died. This allows even the least proficient players to keep playing indefinitely, if they are willing to keep inserting coins. However, each player's final score will be divided by the amount of credits they used to play.

Aside from the ability to have up to four players at once, the game is also noted for the narrator's voice, which is produced by a Texas Instruments TMS5220C speech chip. The TMS5220C speech was encoded by Earl Vickers. The narrator (voiced by Ernie Fosselius) frequently makes statements repeating the game's rules, including: ""Shots do not hurt other players, yet"", ""Remember, don't shoot food"", ""Elf shot the food"", and ""Warrior needs food, badly"". The narrator occasionally comments on the battle by saying, ""I've not seen such bravery"" or ""Let's see you get out of here"". When a player's life force points fall below 200, the narrator states, ""Your life force is running out"", ""Elf needs food"", or ""Valkyrie is about to die"".

The control panel for the four-player cabinet is wider than other standard uprights in order to accommodate four people at the same time. Each player has an eight-way joystick and two buttons: one for ""fire"" (ranged attack) and one for ""magic"". The ""magic"" button also starts the game. After Gauntlet's release, other games started using this design, so it was a popular conversion target for newer games after it had its run."

This version contains the characters and levels from Gauntlet: Legends, plus the new characters and levels from the Dark Legacy arcade game, with a few extra levels thrown in.

Although there are similarities between characters from the two games, each character looks and plays differently. In addition, there are eight alternative-modes for these characters to unlock, plus dozens of secret characters to obtain. With a multi-tap, up to four players can play, with rules governing how much they can hurt each other.

Ghostlop is a head-to-head arcade style puzzle game featuring a unique mix of elements from Puzzle Bobble and Breakout, with a color-switching mechanic reminiscent of Silhouette Mirage and Ikaruga. 

You aim shots the same way as in Puzzle Bobble, but there are only two main colors of bubbles to destroy--or in this case ghosts. The A and B buttons determine whether your shot is red or blue. If your shot is the same color as the ghosts it hits, it will cut through them like in a bonus level of Alleyway. If it's the opposite color, it will bounce off without doing damage. You can switch as often as you like (even while the ball is bouncing around) so if there are a lot of red ghosts surrounded by a layer of blue ghosts, you could detach all of them from the top of the screen by throwing a blue shot to pass through the outer layer, switching to red to move through the middle, and then switching back to blue to pass out the other side, dropping the majority of the ghosts and putting a lot of garbage on your opponent's screen. As your ball bounces around you're free to move your character back and forth along the bottom of the screen, and you need to catch the ball when it comes back or suffer the penalty of having the pieces lower one notch. 

The action is fast-paced and smooth. The lighthearted characters and rockabilly music add a lot of charm that is missing from newer puzzle games like Lumines and Planet Puzzle League."

Progress in the game is made by fighting through Death Adder's henchmen, including men armed with clubs and maces, skeleton warriors, and knights. Players are able to attack by using their weapon and casting spells that hurt all enemies on the screen. The force of this magic depends on the number of bars of magic power currently available. The bars are filled by collecting magic potions attained by kicking the blue thief character who then drops the potions. This character appears during regular levels and bonus stages in between levels. There will also occasionally be a green thief character that drops food which replenishes health. The barbarian, Ax Battler, casts earth spells. The amazon, Tyris Flare, casts fire spells. The dwarf, Gilius Thunderhead, casts lightning spells. Each character has a different maximum number of magic bars and varying ranges of attack. Various steeds known as bizarrians are found in the game. These can be mounted when the enemy rider is knocked off, or if one is found dormant. The least powerful steed is known as the Cockatrice (which also appeared in Altered Beast), that can be used to knock down enemies with a swipe of its tail.

"Gorf","","NTSC-U","United States of America","Midway Manufacturing","Dave Nutting Associates","1981-02-01","2","No","Action | Shooter","E - Everyone","Gorf is a 1981 arcade video game developed by Dave Nutting Associates and released by Midway Manufacturing in the USA on February 1, 1981.

In Gorf, players take control of an unnamed starship from the Interstellar Space Force with a mission to prevent the Gorfian Empire from conquering Earth. The ship is capable of moving freely in all directions around the lower third of the screen under the control of a joystick. This was a departure from older vertically-oriented linear shooters, including Space Invaders and Galaxian, which allowed only horizontal movement of the player's ship controlled by left and right buttons. At the time the joystick input and two-dimensional movement were still unusual enough that contemporary video game guides noted them as distinctive features of Gorf.

Gameplay comprises five distinct missions; each mission presents its own distinct playstyle, but the central goal of each is to destroy all enemies. Successfully completing all five missions increases the player's rank, which represents the current difficulty level of the game, which loops back to the first mission. Gameplay continues until the player loses all of their lives.

Before starting a new game, players can buy up to seven additional lives by purchasing more credits; an extra life is also granted after clearing the first five missions. Unlike similar games where the player can only fire their weapon after an existing shot has disappeared from the screen, the ship is equipped with a laser cannon capable of firing a single vertical shot (called a ""quark laser"") at any time, although doing so causes the previous shot to disappear.

Players can advance through the ranks of Space Cadet, Space Captain, Space Colonel, Space General, Space Warrior and Space Avenger, which increases the speed and difficulty of the game and introduces more enemy patterns. Depending on the version, the player's current rank is displayed via a series of integrated lit panels on the cabinet.

Along the way, a robotic voice heckles and threatens the player, often calling and mocking the player by their current rank. Examples:
""Gorfians take no prisoners"".
""I am the Gorfian consciousness/Empire"".
""My Gorfian robots are unbeatable"".
""Prepare yourself for annihilation"".
""Robot warriors, seek and destroy"".
""Some galactic defender you are!""
""Survival is impossible"".
""You cannot escape the Gorfian robots"".

Missions

Astro Battles: A clone of Space Invaders; it is the only mission that takes place on Earth instead of space. 24 enemies attack in the classic pattern set by the original game; however, the player is protected by a parabolic force field that switches off temporarily when the player's shots pass through it and is gradually worn away by enemy fire.

Laser Attack: The first mission set in space, where the player must battle two formations of five enemies. Each formation contains three yellow enemies that attempt to dive-bomb the player, a white gunner that fires a single laser beam stream, and a red miniature version of the Gorf robot.

Galaxians: As the name implies, this mission is a clone of Galaxian, with the key differences being the number of enemies and the way enemies fire against the player. Gameplay is otherwise similar to the original game.

Space Warp: This mission places the player in a sort of wormhole, where enemies fly outward from the center of the screen and attempt to either shoot down or collide with the player's ship. It is possible to destroy enemy shots in this level.

Flag Ship: The Flag Ship is protected by its own force field, similar to the one protecting the player in Mission 1, and it flies back and forth firing at the player. To defeat it, the player must break through the force field and destroy the ship's core. As with the alien ship in Phoenix, the bottom of the flag ship must be blasted away to expose the vulnerable core. If a different part of the ship is hit, the player receives bonus points, and the part breaks off and flies in a random direction, potentially posing a risk to the player's ship. When the player successfully hits the core, the Flag Ship explodes in a dramatic display, the player advances to the next rank, and play continues on Mission One, with the difficulty increased. Later encounters with the Flag Ship on higher ranks include additional enemies during the mission."

"Gravitar","","Region Not Set","","Atari, Inc.","Atari","1982-01-01","2","No","Shooter","","The player controls a small blue spacecraft. The game starts in a fictional solar system with several planets to explore. If the player moves his ship into a planet, he will be taken to a side-view landscape. Unlike many other shooting games, gravity plays a fair part in Gravitar: the ship will be pulled slowly to the deadly star in the overworld, and downward in the side-view levels.

The player has five buttons: two to rotate the ship left or right, one to shoot, one to activate the thruster, and one for both a tractor beam and force field. Gravitar, Asteroids, Asteroids Deluxe and Space Duel all used similar 5-button controlling system.

In the side-view levels, the player has to destroy red bunkers that shoot constantly, and can also use the tractor beam to pick up blue fuel tanks. Once all of the bunkers are destroyed, the planet will blow up, and the player will earn a bonus. Once all planets are destroyed, the player will move onto another solar system.

The player will lose a life if he crashes into the terrain or gets hit by an enemy's shot, and the game will end immediately if fuel runs out.

Gravitar has 12 different planets. Red Planet is available in all 3 phases in the universe; it contains a reactor. Shooting the reactor core activates a link. Escaping the reactor successfully moves the player to the next phase of planets, awards bonus points and 7500 units of fuel. Reactor escape time reduces after each phase and eventually becomes virtually impossible to complete.

After completing all 11 planets (or alternatively completing the reactor three times) the player enters the second universe and the gravity will reverse. Instead of dragging the ship towards the planet surface, the gravity pushes it away. In the third universe the landscape becomes invisible and the gravity is positive again. The final, fourth universe, has invisible landscape and reverse gravity. After completing the fourth universe the game starts over. However, the reactor escape time will never reset back to high levels again.

The programmers thought that even the best players could never complete the most difficult planets on the invisible levels."

Powerup pickups during the stages have become much rarer now, more enemies now drop money instead, which can be used to buy upgrades in a store after each stage, but usually spending power is very limited, which is the major reason for this game being much harder than Red Hawk.

Guardian Storm was also quite successful internationally, once again some versions have been converted from upright to standard resolution in the localization progress.

The objective of each level is to clear through a buffer of remaining cards for that level (shown by a count on the right side of the screen). At that time, the player is penalized (with a point deduction) for any cards still remaining onscreen. If, after this tally, the player's score is less than zero, the game ends.

"Gun Force II","","Region Not Set","","Irem Corp.","Irem Corp.","1994-01-01","2","No","Action","","Gun Force was an obscure Contra-like game you might have seen at the arcades back in the day. It was ""feed me all your quarters"" hard and pretty much unplayable, but contributed one exciting new element: you could jump into war vehicules and used them against the enemy. Most of you probably didn't even know that it had a sequel. Gun Force 2 was one of the last arcade games (if not the last one) from Irem Corp., published in 1994. When looking at the screenshots, the game's similarity to Metal Slug becomes evident immediately. Yes, Metal Slug is an evolution of this game, as the staff members are actually the same. When Irem Corp. ceased activity, a group of its staff members got together and founded Nazca Corp. They revived their last idea, pumping it up and calling it Metal Slug on the Neo Geo system.

Gun Force 2 is easier and even more enjoyable than Metal Slug. You won't need a dozen quarters to finish it. It's much friendlier and more replayable, but there's less to see and find through out the whole game, as it's just not as technically complex as its modern brother.

Your character is equipped with two guns at the same time that can aim in any direction, at a slightly different angle each. Different weapons are available but only one of your guns can be upgraded, with the other one always keeping the basic shot. There aren't any bombs or grenades, though. Our hero can jump, crouch and hang from ceilings and wires, and also use one of eleven (yes, eleven) war vehicules. This is why Gun Force 2 is so cool. Engaging the enemy with bipedal walkers, jeeps, tanks, and even a Gundam-like flying suit provides such a fuzzy and trigger-happy feeling. Your objective in every level is to rescue hostages for higher scores, which was also later taken over by Metal Slug. Luckily, they are sexy half-dressed cuties instead of Robinson Crusoe's look-a-likes, but they won't leave any rewards or power-ups behind.

Plot-wise, Metal Slug and Gun Force are not related, although you fight off mutants, soldiers and aliens in both games. But technically they are almost identical, utilizing the same graphic design and color palette for backgrounds, explosions and vehicles. There's lots of metal and shrapnel flying everywhere following the extremely well animated explosions (which, interestingly enough, also causes slowdown here). The characters are less cartoonish than Metal Slug. They look more menacing and cool, except for the goofy looking hero, who looks like his arms are going to fall off from carrying those two huge guns. All of the sprites are fluidly animated, with huge mechanical bosses and mini-bosses that perform various attack sequences, with the ability to destroy parts of the background too. The music is just repetitive and bland, but what's interesting is that some of it was first used in another Irem game. They are remixed versions of stages 1, 3 and 4 of Air Duel. Some weapon samples and sound effects are exactly the same as in Metal Slug.

Gun Force 2 looks nothing like its predecessor. The graphic design, playability and animation has completely changed and it's improved in every point. An excellent last arcade jewel from Irem even if you are not a Metal Slug fan, and if you are, do yourself a favor and catch up on the game's roots. You shouldn't miss this."

If one possessed by a shikigami can gather talismans of the five Chinese elements—wood, fire, earth, metal, water—from five demons serving Guwange, then infiltrate Gokumon and slay Guwange, the shikigami will be destroyed and the one possessed will not suffer a premature death."

The graphics are displayed using one-point perspective, with the vanishing point in the center of the screen. The player's ship is restricted to a circumference around the edge of the screen and may move in either direction along this path. All shots from the player converge at the vanishing point.

The majority of enemies are spaceships, which must be destroyed to complete a level. They appear either from the center of the screen or from one of the edges, and move in swirling patterns. They can shoot the player's ship or destroy it by contact. They hover near the center of the screen after completing their deployment pattern, and occasionally fly outwards and shoot at the player. If not destroyed by the player, the enemy ships gradually fly away one by one.

There are also several other types of enemies: satellites, asteroids, and laser beam generators. These appear intermittently and soon disappear of their own accord if not destroyed by the player.

Satellites materialize in a group of three just in front of the player after the ordinary enemy ships have finished deployment. They gyrate in small circles and shoot at the player. If the player has the basic weapon when the satellites appear the middle one will be a sun-like object. If destroyed, the player's ship gets a better weapon. If the better weapon has already been gained then all satellites are identical.

Asteroids fly straight outwards from the center of the screen at regular intervals. They cannot be destroyed, but a small points bonus is given for shooting at them.

Laser beam generators occasionally fly straight outwards from the center of the screen. They consist of two generator segments with a laser beam between them; destroying either generator deactivates the beam. The player's ship is destroyed by contact with either the generators or the beam.

The player begins the game ""2 WARPS TO NEPTUNE"". After completing each level, the player is one warp closer to a planet. Each time a planet is reached, the player's ship is seen flying towards it and then a short bonus round is played, where the player can shoot enemy ships for bonus points without worrying about being destroyed by them. Each enemy destroyed in the bonus stage scores 100 or 10,000 for all 40. After reaching Neptune, the player is then three warps from Uranus, and progresses through Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and finally Earth, taking three warps to reach each planet, then repeats thereafter. At stage 1 and every 10th stage thereafter, the enemies do not fire on the player when entering the screen.

After completing Earth's bonus stage, the player must travel through the very fast ""3 WARPS TO NEPTUNE"" level before he/she can return to the start of the game.

Extra lives will be given at certain point thresholds, varying from one machine to another; but when the player's score is higher than 999,990 points, he/she can no longer obtain score-based extra lives."

"Hard Head","","Region Not Set","","SunA","SunA","1988-01-01","2","No","Action","","Although the official Title Hard Head was the same in every region, SunA's second game used to be known in Korea as ""Jjanggu Baksa"" (Dr. Bulgehead)3. It is incredible how many elements from other games are squeezed into a surprisingly fun melange platformer. Hard Head (and his twin in 2-player mode) carries a bubble gun that encloses enemies into bubbles, which can then be used as trampoline, just like in Bubble Bobble. Similar to Super Mario Bros, items are gained from blocks by jumping at them with the hero's head, while enemies are defeated by stepping on theirs. Then there's passages where one has to break through walls by using a hammer, which is very reminiscent of Wrecking Crew.

However, other than with contemporary titles of home entertainment companies like Clover and Zemina, the designer (who sadly isn't credited at all) had also a few quite unique ideas, like working musical instruments used as platforms, a football that can be found in every stage and kicked through a goal at the level end for extra points. There even is a day/night change hinted at through pallette rotation of the mostly monocoloured background. The game has a time limit, but rather than just killing the player off when it runs out, more and more evil suns come attacking the player already when only little time is left.

The game can be enjoyed by two players simultaneously, who can use each other's head as a springboard to reach higher places without relying on nearby enemies. Only in the second half the game tends to get a bit tedious, as there's almost no new elements introduced after the middle, and those from the early stages grow old fast because of their steady repetition. Less interesting is also the music, which is mostly snatched together from various classical pieces."

Terrorists have seized the underground control complex of a nuclear missile site, and it is up to the player to infiltrate the base and kill the enemy leader. Players begin armed with a laser gun with unlimited ammunition and a limited supply of grenades.

The name of the game is from an in-game weapon. The Heavy Barrel is found in six pieces and is an energy cannon capable of destroying any enemy in the game with a single shot (except the final enemy, and possibly one other boss that may have required two shots). The weapon has a wide arc of fire and can be fired as fast as the player's trigger finger permits, but after thirty seconds its use is exhausted, at which point the bearer reverts to his previous weaponry. Best used to get past tough bosses, the weapon could be built several times in a single game (probably three or four times).

The player takes control of a star ship that can transform in to a mecha by obtaining a specific type of power up.

Set in 2013, mankind's first artificial star and planet, ""Le Tau"", is under attack from genetically modified alien monsters. The player must navigate a ""Heavy Unit"", a heavily armed, transforming mecha, in order to defeat the onslaught and protect the human colony.

The player's ship had two forms: a space-ship and a giant robot. Players started controlling the Heavy Unit in its space-ship form as default. As they progressed, they could change the ship into its robot form, thus changing its firing mode and mobility. A checkpoint was active however and the Heavy Unit only had one hit. Power Ups are dropped by a specific enemy ship which appears in fixed points during the levels. Every level of the game contains a mid-boss and a final boss. Both the ship and the robot modes use two fire buttons, one for the primary (frontal) fire and one for auxiliary fire. The ship mode uses a frontal laser gun which becomes a spread show with the power ups, plus missiles which drops like bombs as auxiliary fire. The robot mode has a frontal laser gun which increases in power with the power ups plus homing missiles as auxiliary fire. An interesting element of the game is represented by the hidden bonuses (usually 1UP) which can be revealed by shooting certain parts of the scenario or by continuously hitting certain indestructible enemies.

(Hi Sho Zame)

Hi Sho Zame is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up in which players pilot a bi-plane over enemy-packed landscapes as they attempt to destroy waves of enemy aircraft, as well as ground-based targets such as tanks and gun emplacements. Naval vehicles also feature, from small single-shot craft up to heavily-armed battle cruisers.

In addition to the standard forward-firing machine guns, players start each stage armed with three 'shatter bombs', these act as smart bombs and are capable of destroying or damaging numerous ground and air targets within a large radius. If the player gets shot down, the shatter bombs are replenished at the start of the next life.

Certain enemy vehicles, such as armoured troop carriers and large bombers, need to be hit several times before they are destroyed. Enemy tanks are often amassed in underground bunkers and if the player succeeds in blowing these open, the tanks inside can be destroyed before they are deployed.

As well as the standard enemy planes, squadrons of red, blue or yellow enemy planes also appear. Destroying a yellow squadron awards bonus points but destroying a red squadron releases a flashing 'S' icon, collecting this increases the player's fire power and can be done several times. Destroying a blue squadron earns the player an extra life. 

Some of the ground-based tank units release a red 'B' icon when destroyed, picking this up awards the player with a shatter bomb. Each stage starts and ends on an airport runway and extra points are awarded for any shatter bombs the player has remaining.

Hi Sho Zame consists of five different stages, after which the game repeats from the second stage onwards with an increased level of difficulty."

High Voltage is a first person space shoot-em-up with a 3D perspective. Each stage starts in space, and ends up on the surface of the planet, culminating in a fight with a boss machine.

Being hit with a projectile will cause enough damage to crack your view-port, and lose one of your lives. In addition to the standard rapid-fire lasers, which may overheat if used excessively, you have a limited supply of bombs which cause greater damage to a larger area. For each stage, your arrival at the planet surface intercepts an ABO transporter. Destroying this vessel provides you with a robotic companion who can detect bonuses hidden just below the surface of the planet, retrieve extra missiles for your use from the surface, and provides in-game commentary.

The player characters are armed with a gun complete with energy pack reminiscent to the Ghostbusters franchise to shoot various ghosts and monsters that infest each stage, though players can also defeat enemies by jumping on them, in addition of performing a double jump to move across platforms as well. Along the way, players can collect multiple a weapon power-up to change their gun to fire lasers, bombs or a spread shot. Other items can also be collected during gameplay such as ""P"" icons that, after collecting three icons in a row, grants the players a shield that takes an extra enemy hit and heart icons that gives points. Firing on determined locations is crucial to reach high-scores and get extra lives, as certain setpieces in some stages hosts bonus secrets.

The opening stages of the title take place in an eastern setting, featuring various spirits and creatures of Japanese folklore. Some of these include ghostly karakasa, chochinobake, kappa, hitotsume-kozou and rokurokubi. The game then changes course, moving to a ghostly pirate ship and then the haunted American Old West, featuring a ghost town and a canyon inhabited by traditional ghosts and monsters from western culture such as Frankenstein's monster, Dracula, and even Jason Voorhees-style masked monsters. The game's final stretch takes place in a medieval setting complete with cursed castles and dungeons infested with haunted armor, goblins and dragons.

Demon's World uses a checkpoint in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying. Getting hit by enemy fire, colliding against certain stage obstacles, falling off the stage or running against any enemy will result in losing a live and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. Although there is an ending, the game loops back to the first stage after completing the last stage as with previous titles from Toaplan, with each one increasing the difficulty."

The game takes place between the events of The House of the Dead 2 and The House of the Dead III, and introduced several new gameplay concepts. Players can control characters James Taylor, from The House of the Dead 2 (on the left side), or Kate Green, a new character to the series (on the right side). The game was followed by House of the Dead: Scarlet Dawn.

The House of the Dead 4 is the first game to run on the Sega Lindbergh arcade system board.

The player can reload the gun by shaking it, or by just pointing off the screen. The game also features grenades that the player can throw to destroy large numbers of enemies. Additional grenades can be earned by completing certain tasks or by shooting crates. At some points in the game, players are required to shake the gun vigorously in order to escape certain situations.

The game features branching paths. Most of the paths lead to the same point in the game's story. As with The House of the Dead III, there is an end-of-stage bonus where players can receive extra lives depending on headshot level combo, accuracy, and score. Another returning factor is the presence of the ""Cancel"" bar.

The game runs on a critical shots counter where the player is encouraged to shoot the enemy's weak points rather than spraying ammo at the enemy. It starts off as Good, Excellent, Amazing and then Perfect. Getting hit, or killing an enemy not by the weak point resets the counter.

The most common enemies have three attacks. A ""normal attack"", a ""grab,"" and a ""push"". The foremost inflicts one point of damage, while the second forces a shaking sequence that, if successful, pushes back attackers for easier disposal, but if unsuccessful, will result in the player being bitten or the player's character being knocked down and vulnerable. Multiple zombies may also pile on top of both players in an attempt to stomp on them (or kick them while they're down).

There are also a number of secrets in the game. Different hidden treasures, such as coins and golden shapes, which increase the player's score, as well as ""lives"", etc. can be found by interacting with the game's environments. The bonus-life system departs from the previous games, where life is gained by saving hostages; the loss of these events are substituted with an increase of extra-life pickups in the environment. There are also ""treasure rooms"" that can be accessed using different techniques (such as shooting a certain spot or throwing a grenade in a certain area), which contain multiple items that can be obtained at once within a limited time.

Plot
In 2003, three years after the Goldman Case, veteran American AMS agent James Taylor, and a new rookie agent, Kate Green, are gathering intelligence at the fifth basement floor of the European headquarters of the AMS in Italy (London in the Japanese dub). James has a sharp memory of the 2000 ""Goldman Case"", and believes that the ordeal has not yet ended. A sudden earthquake rocks the room while they talk, collapsing the basement walls and leaving the agents trapped.

Several days later, as the two await a rescue team, James' PDA goes off, and a group of undead are seen on the security cameras. Realizing that they are in danger, James has Kate gather all the weaponry they can find to defend themselves. Soon after, the two travel through the sewers to an information room where they uncover a plot to fire nuclear missiles worldwide within 24 hours' time, facing the four-armed giant zombie Justice and a pair of mutant tarantulas known as The Lovers along the way. Taking the subway into zombie-infested streets from an underground shopping district, the agents narrowly avoid attacks by The Empress, a double-ended chainsaw-wielding assassin, and the massive, obese, and nearly impervious Temperance.

James and Kate then learn that the late one-time CEO of the now-defunct DBR Corporation, Goldman, is responsible for the resurgence of undead. All of his messages and current plans were set in motion even before his death. Upon reaching the surface, they find the city completely obliterated. Goldman sends them a PDA message indicating that the launch will occur in one hour. The agents head for the abandoned Goldman Building and upon arrival, a levitating humanoid named The Star, confronts them in the foyer. After the Star is defeated, the duo arrive in time to halt the missile launch, though it is revealed that Goldman's true intention is to revert humankind to its original state in order to prevent them from harming the planet further. As such, his final legacy, The World, an insectoid humanoid with powers over ice, is released in the opening of ""Pandora's Box"" to fulfill its role as the successor to his original Emperor project in 2000, having developed underground since his death. As the AMS agents fight it, the World continuously evolves to become larger and more powerful. Following the World's second defeat, James sets his PDA to self-destruct and, telling Kate not to give up hope, sacrifices himself to destroy the World in the ensuing explosion. A shaken and distraught Kate walks out of Goldman's premises.

Endings
The game has four endings available depending on the player's performance result during the game, which at the end of either endings, the screen displays ""The story continues in The House of the Dead III"".

Standard Ending: A view of Goldman's computer playing a recording of him saying that ""the human race has not been eliminated"", instructing to ""travel north"" while musing that ""hope is such a splendid thing"" as he leaves the room.
Bad Ending: The ending plays out the same as the standard ending but the camera pans on Goldman's face showing him changing into a zombie.
""G"" Ending: G appears outside the Goldman building, and states that the zombie crisis has not yet ended while telling James to rest in peace and he will assist the heroes to face what awaits. This ending has G in his House of the Dead III appearance, suggesting to have took place after The House of the Dead 4 Special and right before the events of The House of The Dead III, as the game suggests the story continues in The House of The Dead III.
Mystery Man Ending: The unnamed mysterious man previously seen in one of The House of the Dead III's ending, sits in his study, declaring Goldman to be soft and that humans have no need of hope, before stating that the true end shall soon begin and that there is more than one Pandora's Box.
Development
Video display
The House of the Dead 4 was the first arcade light gun game to feature a high-definition widescreen display. The different displays used for each of the models are as follows: Mitsubishi's 2005 62"" rear-projection DLP 16:9 ratio widescreen model for the ""Super Deluxe"" cabinet (although later models of the game would use Toshiba, Zenith, and LG rear-projections), LG's 2005 52"" rear-projection DLP 4:3 ratio model for the ""Deluxe""-sized cabinet, and Sanwa or Nanao color monitor 29"" CRT 4:3 ratio television for the ""upright"" cabinet (although it is a CRT set and can only accept a 480i signal, it has a high screen resolution of 676 dots by 625 lines). The game runs in 1080i on the Deluxe and Super Deluxe cabinets and in 480i on the standard cabinet.

The video signal is connected via a DVI to HDMI adapter for the Super Deluxe cabinet, VGA for the Deluxe cabinet, and S-Video for the Standard cabinet."

"Hydro Thunder","","NTSC-U","United States of America","Midway Games","Midway Studios - San Diego","1999-02-01","4","No","Racing","E - Everyone","Hydro Thunder is a 1999 arcade racing video game developed by Midway Studios San Diego and released by Midway Games in the USA on February 1, 1999.

The gameplay of Hydro Thunder is similar to Sega's Daytona USA. It consists of racing high-tech speedboats through treacherous environments, from the cold seas of the Arctic Circle to a post-apocalyptic version of New York City.

Scattered across the tracks are blue and red boost icons. When touched, these icons allow the player who touched them to boost. Red boost icons are more scarce than blue boost icons because they give more boost fuel. When a player has boost fuel, they may use the boost button to boost, which increases the boat's speed and allows the player knock other boats into the air, a feature described by the game as the Mighty Hull. Another aspect of boosting is the Hydro Jump, which is performed by braking and using the boost button. When combined with the many ramps on the tracks, players can reach short cuts and boost icons that would otherwise be inaccessible.

The boats in Hydro Thunder are divided into four categories: easy, medium, hard, and bonus. There are three easy, medium, and hard boats and four bonus boats. The easy boats tend to have the easiest handling but do not have the speed of other classes, the hard boats are usually very difficult to control but are very fast, and the medium boats fall in the middle. The bonus boats are a combination of these qualities.

The tracks in Hydro Thunder, like the boats, are divided into four classes: easy, medium, hard, and bonus. The easy tracks are usually short and simple, the hard tracks are dark and difficult to navigate, and the medium tracks fall in the middle. The bonus tracks have a combination of easy and difficult qualities, the longest track being one of them. The arcade version of the game had only two bonus tracks, New York Disaster and Nile Adventure. Hydro Speedway was present as a hidden track. The console versions add two more, Catacomb and Castle Von Dandy, making four in all.

By placing first, second, or third on the easy tracks, the player unlocks the medium tracks and boats. Hard tracks and boats are unlocked by placing first or second on the medium tracks. Bonus tracks are accessed by placing first on the hard tracks, and the bonus boats are then unlocked by placing first on the bonus tracks."

Side Arms uses two shooting buttons, one for shooting to the left and the other to the right. The third button is used to change between the weapons acquired by the player. There are five types of power-ups that can be acquired by the player: a speed upgrade, an orbital bit that will provide additional firepower with the standard gun, a shotgun with shoots in a fan-shaped range, a three-way shooter, and a mega bazooka launcher that fires a laser beam. The player can choose what power-up their mecha will receive by shooting the power-up icon until getting the item they want. All of the weapons, as well as the mecha's speed, can be upgraded up to two or even three levels depending on the item. There is also a speed downgrade that will reduce the Mobilsuit's speed by one level. There are also two ""Auto"" power-ups, shaped like the enemy characters from Vulgus: one is shaped like the ""Yashichi"" and allows the player to fire continuously with either firing button held down; while the other, which is shaped like the ""Sakichi"", allows the player to shoot upwards, downwards and forwards at the same time, but at a slower rate than the regular shot.

In addition to the standard power-ups, there are two special combination power-ups shaped like the Greek letters α and β that will combine the player's Mobilsuit with an ally. This allows the player to do an eight-directional attack at the same time as their regular attack. When two players are playing this power-up will combine both players' suits instead. One player will move the combined suit and perform the regular attack, while the other will provide the eight-directional attack. If the combined suit gets shot by an enemy soldiers, it will revert both suits into their regular separate states."

The goal is for the greedy protagonist to collect all the gold bars while jumping over or defeating various enemies and obstacles in each maze-like level. Some of these enemies are: Giant Baba (a Japanese wrestler), a moonwalking Michael Jackson, Madonna, Japanese comedian Tamori, Carl Lewis, moving statues (activated when passed by). Some obstacles include: Gates, ""fire"" hydrants, safes (making it difficult to gain access to the gold), a rolling barrel, conveyor belts, and a swimming pool with platforms ranging in size and strength. When you collect all the gold in a given level, you must cash it into a building (labeled ""out"" when the level begins and ""in"" once you retrieve all the gold) to beat the level. The player can only hold ten bars of gold at once. In later levels there are more than 10 bars of gold, so the player must make multiple deposits."

"Ice Cold Beer","","Other","","Taito Corporation","Taito Corporation","1983-01-01","1","No","Puzzle","Not Rated","Ice Cold Beer is a mechanical arcade game released by Taito in 1983. The game is in a similar cabinet to an arcade video game, but where the screen would normally be there is a vertical wooden playfield dotted with holes. Two joysticks on the control panel control the height of the two ends of a metal bar that moves up and down the playfield, with a ball bearing rolling back and forth on the bar. The playfield is an amber color, and the holes in the playfield are suggestive of bubbles rising in a mug of beer.
The objective of the game is to use the two joysticks to tip the bar back and forth and maneuver the ball up to a specific lit hole on the playfield, while avoiding unlit holes. When the player deposits the ball in the lit hole, the ball and the bar return to the bottom of the playfield, and the next target hole is lit. The game begins with the bottom-most hole lit, and subsequent lit holes become more and more difficult to reach while avoiding unlit holes. There are also versions with a ticket dispenser.

Taito also released a ""family friendly"" version of the game in 1984 entitled Zeke's Peak, where the artwork of bubbles rising in a mug of beer was replaced by a mountain-climbing theme. The main character is Zeke, the protagonist from Taito's earlier arcade game Zoo Keeper.

In 2003, ICE (Innovative Concepts in Entertainment) released a remake of the game with new artwork and a ticket dispenser.

As of 2021, the world record is held by Matthew Ackerman with a score of 2,160,000 points.

Rather than facing a formation of 55 invaders, there are fewer than a dozen per any given screen. Even though the invaders look exactly like the forces players faced from the original arcade game, for the most part, they do not adhere to the regular Invaders rule of moving to the side and dropping down a notch when they reach a screen edge, as the invaders mostly move diagonally. They also not only fire vertically, but diagonally as well, at times catching the player's[s'] ship in a crossfire (which is what increases the difficulty level with this game, as it is much higher than most Invaders games in general). Sometimes when an invader is shot, its body will quickly fall to the bottom of the screen and is deadly to a player's ship upon contact. The small invaders will also, after several rounds, shrink to half their width with every other move, making them harder to hit.

Players also have a fuel level to maintain, which occasionally an invader will drop down vertically to pick up a fuel cell at the bottom of the screen. If they make it back up to the top of the screen with the fuel cell, a notch of fuel will be deducted from the player's total. There are also big bombs (bigger than the ones the invaders fire) that drop from the top of the screen during levels, which will also deduct fuel if they make contact with the bottom of the screen/player's fuel supply.

After several rounds, the player must dock with the ship normally seen at the top of the screen (which the ships switch areas then, with the player's ship appearing at the top while the refueling ship appears at the bottom) to be refueled. The player must first avoid several squares in the middle of the screen, then dock with the center of the refueling ship to refuel and earn a bonus, then the game will start over at the beginning wave once more.

And unlike most other official Space Invaders games or clones, there is no UFO that appears overhead, as the refueling ship cannot be shot.

Being hit by any invader, bomb, docking square, falling fuel cell, or not landing directly in the center of the refueling ship will destroy the player's ship. The game will end when there are no more remaining ships or the player runs out of fuel. An extra ship is awarded at 1500 points."

The games were developed by the same team who are responsible for the Street Fighter III series.

It was originally released in the arcade in 1998 on the CPS-3 arcade system; this version was known outside Japan as JoJo's Venture. An updated version of the game was released in 1999 as JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Heritage for the Future (ジョジョの奇妙な冒険 未来への遺産 JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken Mirai e no Isan?), becoming the sixth and last game released for the CPS-3 board. Console ports for the PlayStation and Dreamcast were also released that year. A high-definition version of the game was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in August 2012.[1]

The game combines Capcom's trademark anime-inspired graphics, as seen in the Darkstalkers series, with the colorful characters and events of Hirohiko Araki's creation, resulting in a highly stylized and detailed visual style. It also features many of the gameplay mechanics seen on previous Capcom fighting games, such as the use of power gauges for super moves, as well as a brand new Stand Mode, consisting of a guardian spirit that accompanies each character and can be summoned or dismissed at will by the player, resulting in variations on the character's move list and abilities.

Original author Hirohiko Araki served as a consultant for the game and created exclusive pieces of artwork for its promotion and packaging; most notably, he developed from scratch a new character design for Midler, since Capcom was interested in using her in the game and she had been only vaguely shown in the original manga."

The game may be played by up to two players simultaneously. Controls for each player consist of a two-position joystick and a button. The screen contains several platforms, with the left and right edges wrapping around to each other. Each press of the button flaps the mount's wings; based on the rate at which it is pressed, the knight can ascend or descend at a desired rate or hover in midair. The joystick can be used to steer left and right in midair, or run in a chosen direction if the knight is standing on a platform.

Each wave consists of several enemy knights, in three types and armed with lances. When a player's knight and an enemy collide, the one whose lance is at a higher vertical level unseats the other; if the lances are at the same height, the two knights rebound from the collision. Each defeated enemy turns into an egg, which the player can pick up for bonus points. After a short period of time, the egg will hatch into a knight of the next higher difficulty level than the defeated one. If this knight acquires a new mount before the player can pick it up, it returns to the game and must be defeated again. The wave ends when all enemy knights have been defeated and their eggs picked up or destroyed.

Later waves introduce further complications and difficulties, such as:
A chance to earn a bonus for completing a wave without losing any lives
Destruction of portions of the bottommost platform to expose pools of lava. Any knight or egg that falls in is immediately destroyed.
The emergence of the Lava Troll, a disembodied hand that can reach up from the lava and try to drag down knights that approach too closely. The player can escape its grip with repeated, rapid flapping.
Disappearance of some of the midair platforms.
Waves that begin with eggs scattered all over the screen instead of enemies.
The appearance of a pterodactyl, which flies randomly around the screen and tries to unseat the players' knights. A precisely timed and aimed lance strike is required to defeat it for bonus points.

In a two-player game, the players may cooperatively complete the waves or attack each other as desired.

One life is lost whenever a player's knight is unseated, or falls or is dragged into the lava. A player's game ends when all lives are lost."

The player uses a button and joystick to control a knight riding a flying ostrich. The object is to progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards. Joust 2 features improved audio-visuals and gameplay elements absent from the original.

The game uses more advanced hardware than the original Joust, allowing for the new elements. John Newcomer led development again, which began to create a conversion kit that allowed arcade owners to convert the cabinet into another game. Williams chose a vertically oriented screen for the kit as a result of the design's popularity at the time. Released during the waning days of the golden age of arcade games, Joust 2 did not achieve the success that Joust reached. The game was later released on home consoles as part of arcade compilations."

The pace of the game is frustrating because the hands move slowly while the car itself moves really fast, especially in the later rounds. If one of your hands hits a tree or any other foreign object in its quest for food, the car winces in pain for a few moments until it can use its hands again.

You can get a bonus for putting used-up food into garbage cans. Grabbing fish which leap out of surrounding rivers is a safe bet, but most other bonuses are placed, so you can crash if you try to grab them.

Jr. Pac-Man is the eighth game in the Pac-Man series and the fifth and final game in the Pac-Man series to be developed without Namco's involvement.

The core gameplay of Jr. Pac-Man is similar to its predecessors. The player controls the eponymous Jr. Pac-Man (who wears an animated propeller beanie), and scores points by eating all of the dots in the maze, while four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Tim, who replaces Clyde) chase him around the maze and attempt to catch him. Eating a power pellet turns the ghosts blue, briefly allowing the player to eat them for extra points. Once the maze is cleared, a new maze is presented and the gameplay continues.

The mazes are now twice the width of the monitor and scroll horizontally. A total of seven mazes appear throughout the game, and five of them have six power pellets instead of four, but none of them have tunnels that wrap around from one side of the screen to the other.

Bonus items (such as tricycles, kites, and balloons) appear in each round, starting above the ghosts' lair and moving around the maze as in Ms. Pac-Man. As an item encounters dots, it changes them into larger ones that award more points but slow Jr. Pac-Man down while he is eating them. After a certain length of time, the item will move toward one of the remaining power pellets (if any) and explode on contact if not eaten, destroying both itself and the pellet. Contact between Jr. Pac-Man and a non-vulnerable ghost costs the player one life and makes any large dots either disappear or revert to normal ones, depending on how many dots overall are left in the maze.

The between-level intermissions show the developing relationship between Jr. Pac-Man and a small red ghost named Yum-Yum who is apparently the daughter of Blinky."

The team was motivated to do a game around this funny monkey.

On February 02, 1989, the first prototype was ready: one level, no enemies, no musics and the monkey can jump only (no shoot). At this point, they decided to reprogram the game entirely from 0. Note JuJu Densetsu was coded with the same system used by the neogeo coders at SNK.

During the first location test (at the TAD office) on September 07, 1989, many new ideas came to the developers but most of them were not included in the final product (i.e: snakes on the first stage), because lack of time.

On September 15, 1989. a public location test was done in Japan AND in the USA (University of Washington). A second test was done in October. After this test, they decided to program the end of the game (done by a non-programmer in a week-end). Note: The girl you have to save is brune in the attract mode and blonde at the end.

The game was finished on November 06, 1989.

Then, after about 10 months of development, JuJu Densetsu was finally released on December 08, 1989 in Japan by TAD. 3148 arcade boards were sold. Export releases: ""Toki"".

The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Legend of JuJu'.

The devil monkey with horns from the level 2 is called Bellzador (Dev. code name: Akuma Zaru) and has the most complex AI routine. It takes 27 pages 'A4' format in the source code. Its desing and patern were inspired by Red Arremer from Makaimura.

There is some unused sprites for the character's animation in the game code.

On February 26, 1990, TAD know that pirate versions of their game appear on the market.

This was the last video game developed by TAD. A sequel was planned (JuJu 2! an action puzzle game) for the Super Famicom but the company closed its door 2 months after the JuJu Desnsetsu release. Fortunately, the source code of JuJu 2 was sold to Altron Corp. who released the game as ""Little Magic [Model SHVC-LI]"".

Scene 2 has the explorer navigating a crocodile-infested river. The explorer can attack the crocodiles from below with his knife, unless their mouths are open. The explorer must return to the surface periodically to breathe, where he cannot attack the crocodiles. Bubbles periodically rise from the bottom of the river, which can trap the explorer and carry him to the surface, potentially hitting crocodiles on the way.

Scene 3 involves the explorer dodging various-sized boulders rolling and bouncing towards him as he runs up the side of a volcano. Timing is critical as the differently sized boulders bounce at different speeds and heights, requiring the explorer to either jump or duck at the appropriate moment.

In the final scene, the explorer must evade cannibals while attempting to get to a woman being lowered into a flaming cauldron. After the player rescues the woman, the word ""Congratulations!"" appears, which is then followed by a message saying ""I Love You!!!"" followed by the woman kissing the explorer.

Further gameplay repeats the scenes with increased difficulty. On rounds other than the first, a cannibal appears in the tree of the cauldron scene and throws spears at the player."

When all three enemies are defeated, the player advances to the next maze.

The enemy creatures appear in one of three colors: red, yellow or green. Red creatures are longer in length than the player, and as such a collision with the creature will cost the player one life. Yellow creatures are the same length as the player, thus posing no harm upon a collision. Green creatures are shorter than the player, and will be devoured by the player's creature if they collide. The player can shoot at the creatures, with each hit reducing the number of segments by one. As segments are removed, the creatures are able to move faster, thus making them harder to catch and eliminate.

Points are scored for shooting the creatures, as well as for collecting pieces of fruit that appear in the maze at random locations. These fruits will also add an extra segment to the player's creature."

There are four different levels. Three of them consist of the mother kangaroo on the bottom floor trying to reach the top floor where her joey is being held captive by some monkeys. On each of the levels monkeys throw apples and apple cores, which the mother kangaroo must either jump, duck, or punch. If she gets face to face with one of the monkeys, she can punch it with a boxing glove. There are also pieces of fruit that she can jump up and get for points; if she jumps and touches a bell, higher-value fruits will appear to replace the ones she has already collected. She must be wary of the big Ape, who will occasionally appear and try to take her gloves away from her. The level must be completed before the time runs out; otherwise, the player will lose a life.

Levels 1, 2 and 4 consist of different platforms that the mother kangaroo must jump onto or climb onto via a ladder. On the third level, the joey is in a cage held up by a troop of monkeys, and there is a horde of apples that will be unleashed if five monkeys climb up to it. On this level, the mother kangaroo must punch each monkey in the stack several times until the cage is lowered and, when the cage has been lowered enough, the mother kangaroo must climb to the next floor to get to the joey before the cage is raised again.

The game uses classical and folk songs, including ""Turkish March"" by Ludwig van Beethoven (at game start), ""American Patrol"" by F. W. Meacham (during regular gameplay), ""Oh! Susanna"" by Stephen Foster (level completion fanfare), and ""Westminster Quarters"" (when a bell is rung)."

Enemies emerge from doorways to attack the player; some fight hand-to-hand, while others throw projectiles.

Food items occasionally float across the screen and can be struck for bonus points.

The player can take three hits from enemies or their projectiles and continue fighting, but a fourth hit costs one life. Each step is divided into two parts; the second half includes a fight against a boss character, who requires five hits to defeat and may have a special attack technique. Once all enemies in either half of a step are defeated, the player earns bonus points based on the number of hits taken in that half and the damage meter is fully restored.

King & Balloon plays like Galaxian, but trades the outer space theme for a pseudo-medieval setting. In the game, the player controls two green men who carry a cannon, as they defend the king below them from getting abducted by the balloons above, which keep invading the lower part of the screen while also shooting projectiles. Once all the balloons are shot down, the game moves on to the next level.

One thing that makes King & Balloon unique is that you don't lose a life when hit. Rather, you respawn and keep on playing. The only way to lose a life is letting the king get abducted. Another interesting mechanic of note is that the balloons stop attacking and descending when one grabs ahold of the king, and they will keep still until the king is back on the ground.

"King of Boxer","Ring King","Region Not Set","","Data East Corporation","Wood Place Inc.","1985-01-01","2","No","Fighting | Sports","","Ring King is a boxing game in which the action in the ring is viewed in a 3D top-down view and a full range of moves is provided, with the standard jabs complimented by body punches and the ability to dodge, duck or raise your guard.

Each punch weakens your opponent's strength which can slightly recover during a round break. A rain of well placed blows can produce a quick knockout, but normally you must hit your opponent many times before he goes down.

The game has three play modes. There is training mode to train your player before you enter a tournament. A ranking mode where you can select one of the three championships, Rookie, Japan and World. Each championship can be played at five difficulty levels. The third mode is the tournament mode. To reach the number one spot in the ranking or tournament mode you must train your boxer well.

Before you start you must create your character and set his initial abilities, strength, speed and stamina. Each won bout increases these abilities slightly. The abilities of your opponent and you are visible in the status bar at the top of the screen during the game. Strength is represented with a boxing glove, speed with a shoe and stamina with a dumb bell.

This game can be played by one player against the computer or by two players against each other. A password is given after each won bout and it enables you to continue with the next match in a tournament at a later time."

Nine fighters had entered the tournament from within sight and that each of them had battled against one another from within a strong and relentless manner, but in the end, Sho Hayate had proven to be the strongest competitor and that he had won the tournament while defeating King Leo (and his fake impersonator King Lion) from within the finals of the tournament.

To seek revenge against Hayate and those who caused his humiliating downfall, King Leo has organized a second version of the Battle of the Beast God tournament, but this time, there's a new rule. Teams of 2 people must work together from within this new tournament so that they can either ensure victory or face defeat. The competitors from last year's tournament have learned of King Leo's new tournament and that each of them have decided to join forces with each other on either friendly or temporary terms. With the exception of Carol Stanzack (who decides to skip the tournament to continue her gymnastics training) and Nicola Zaza (who's too busy in having to work on his latest scientific project), Hayate and the fighters from the previous tournament have returned for combat and that they're ready to face the latest challenge that's presented to them by King Leo. 

However, the previous fighters aren't the only ones from within this tournament, as two new challengers have entered into the fray and that they have their own reasons in battling from within King Leo's new competition. The gathered fighters must be ready and prepared to not only fight against each other and King Leo from within this tournament, but also, they must deal with a possible unknown threat that lies directly from within the shadows of this competition as well."

The Photon arcade cabinet was produced in the late 1980s to early 1990s by the eponymous cooperative in Penza. Components were purchased from the plants of Voronezh, Saransk and Nizhny Novgorod. Machines were purchased from the manufacturer ""Union"" and the Ministry of Culture. The volume of production of automatic machines was up to 150 units per month.


The Photon machine with a PC8000 (Russian: ПК8000) card has three games loaded on it. The game variants of the machine differ by a sign with instructions depending on the installed game.
    Питон (Python)
    Клад / Лабиринт (Klad / Labyrinth, Treasure / Labyrinth)
    Тетрис (Tetris)
Versions of the games ""Labyrinth"" and ""Treasure"" also exist for the ordinary PC8000. The versions differ due to the lack of a coin acceptor and a time counter.

The following sets of games are known for the ZX Spectrum-compatible machine:
    Бродяга (Brodjaga, Inspector Gadget and the Circus of Fear)
    Чёрный корабль (Czernyj Korabl, Black Beard)
    Повар / Собрать Буран / Агропром (Povar / Sobrat' Buran / Agroprom, Cookie / Jetpack / Pssst)

Made on the basis of a slightly modified Soviet PC8000 consumer computer. The modification entails replacing the ROM chips with the BASIC interpreter with the ROM with the game program. Also, there is no keyboard and piezo emitter mounted on the computer board for audio playback. Instead, the sound output is connected to a tape recorder. The joystick is connected to the standard connector of the joystick.
Also known is a later version of the automaton, Foton-IK02, where the ZX Spectrum-compatible board is used. Compared to the PC8000 mainboard, its graphics capabilities are weaker, but faster. 


In 2009, enthusiasts dumped a ROM from one of the games for the machine (Tetris). Support for the machine with a PC8000 board and the first game for it was added to the MAME emulator in version 0.133u1 in August 2009. The next version (0.134, September of the same year) adds support for a machine with a ZX Spectrum-compatible card."
"Klax","","Region Not Set","","Atari Games","Atari Games","1990-02-01","2","Yes","Puzzle","Not Rated","Klax is a puzzle game designed by Dave Akers and Mark Stephen Pierce. The object is to line up colored blocks into rows of similar colors to make them disappear, to which the object of Columns is similar. Atari Games originally released it as a coin-op follow up to Tetris, about which they were tangled in a legal dispute at the time.
     Klax features a conveyor belt at the top of the screen. It constantly rolls toward the playing area, delivering a steady supply of blocks. The player controls a small device which sits at the interface between the conveyor belt and the playing area, which can be moved left and right to catch the blocks and deposit them either in the playing area (which can hold 25 blocks in a 5x5 arrangement) or push them back up the conveyor belt. The device can hold up to five blocks. An uncaught block is considered a ""drop"". A flashing block can be used as a wildcard on any color. In the playing area, blocks can be eliminated by arranging three or more of the same color into a continuous line, known as a ""Klax."" The line may be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. A multiple grouping (e.g., one vertical and horizontal) counts as multiple Klaxes, as does Klaxes of four same-colored blocks (two Klaxes) or five same-colored blocks (three Klaxes). Once the goal is reached, bonus points are awarded for remaining blocks on the conveyor belt and device, and empty spaces in the bin (also, on levels where a certain point total is required, points in excess of the required amount are counted both in the scoring and as bonus points).
     Klax consists of 100 levels grouped into blocks of five. At the beginning of the game and after each fifth level (levels divisible by five, except for Levels 95 and 100), a player can choose to skip five or ten levels. Skipping levels gives bonus points and a higher drop allowance. The game ends when the player either exhausts their drop allowance, fills up their playing area, or finishes level 100"

One day, Nyan questions the Chinese Zodiac and wonders why a cat isn't part of the zodiac while others like the dog and monkey are. Dodonpa isn't really bothered by it so much and sort of teases Nyan but then he too wonders about it and Nyan (feeling inspired) gets optimistic. The story of the game has Nyan and Dodonpa eventually going to meet a fairy after battling 12 animals (specifically of the Chinese Zodiac) in order to make the request that cats be part of the zodiac. Apparently, if you play with player 2 and beat the game, the ending is slightly different or so I hear.

Kokontouzai Eto Monogatari (KEM from this point forward) roughly translates into ""Chinese Astrology Story for All Ages"". However, the game has a lot of stages for a puzzle game (13 to be exact) and the speed picks up pretty quickly so as childish as it looks, it definitely requires skill on the later levels. It is a fairly simple and charming game (it's funny how the cow/ox of stage 2 will ""power-up"" and win by drinking milk, lol), but the CPU definitely shows aggression pretty quickly (if you couldn't tell by watching this video). Visually, the game is pretty good and doesn't do anything over-the-top, but still manages to be pretty decent for the genre. The audio is okay; I don't have any qualms with it, but nothing really jumps out at me (the music is geared for the kids). It's not necessarily my cup of tea, but it isn't necessarily bad (I have different tastes in music).

KEM plays like many other drop puzzlers in the general sense; you match three blocks and they disappear. You can create chains and drop big piles of junk on your opponent. To destroy said junk and get your breathing room back, you must match blocks that are touching the junk. When you do so, the blocks and junk next to it will both vanish. KEM does have a trick up its sleeve; orbs that when matched, destroy all treasure boxes (just another type of block that you can chain with) as well as any orbs you didn't match that are scattered on your screen. By matching three orbs together when your screen is full of blocks, you can cause massive chain reactions or massive gatherings of blocks to be destroyed all at once. Naturally, you will deal a huge blow to your adversary when you do this so timing is essential (and the opponent can too so watch out!).

At any rate, KEM is a pretty decent game to play with silly characters and decent audio/visuals."

The player controls Thomas with an eight-way joystick and two attack buttons to punch and kick. Unlike more conventional side-scrolling games, the joystick is used not only to crouch, but also to jump. Punches and kicks can be performed from a standing, crouching or jumping position. Punches award more points than kicks and do more damage, but their range is shorter. Thomas has a health meter indicating how much damage he can take. He can absorb a significant amount of damage, but loses a life if he takes too many hits.

Underlings encountered by the player include Grippers, who can grab Thomas and drain his energy until shaken off; Knife Throwers, who can throw at two different heights and must be hit twice; and Tom Toms, short fighters who can either grab Thomas or somersault to strike his head when he is crouching. On even-numbered floors, the player must also deal with falling balls and pots, snakes, poisonous moths, fire-breathing dragons, and exploding confetti balls.

The Devil's Temple has five floors, each ending with a different boss (described as ""sons of the devil"" at the start of the game). Each boss has a health meter like Thomas, which leads to the game temporarily becoming a one-on-one fighting game during a boss battle. In order to complete a floor, Thomas must connect enough strikes to completely drain the boss's energy meter; he can then climb the stairs to the next floor. Thomas has a fixed time limit to complete each floor; if time runs out or his meter is completely drained, the player loses one life and must replay the entire floor. Upon completing a floor, the player receives bonus points for remaining time and energy.

The bosses of the first four levels are Stick Fighter, Boomerang Fighter, Giant, and Black Magician. The boss of the fifth floor is Mr. X, the leader of the gang that kidnapped Sylvia. Once he is defeated, Thomas rescues Sylvia and the game restarts at a higher difficulty level.

An extra life is given at 50,000 points; thereafter, the rest of the game is on ""survival of the fittest"" mode. Play continues until the last Thomas is dead, which ends the game."

"Lady Bug","","NTSC-U","United States of America","Universal U.S.A., Inc.","Universal Entertainment Corporation","1981-12-01","2","No","Action","E - Everyone","Lady Bug is a 1981 arcade video game developed by Universal and released by Universal USA in the USA on December 1, 1981.

The goal of Lady Bug is to eat all ""flowers,"" hearts, and letters in the maze while avoiding other insects. The player is represented by a red, yellow, and green character resembling a ladybug while the enemy insects' appearance varies by level. The border of the maze acts as timer, with each circuit signaling the release of an enemy insect from the central area, up to (generally) a maximum of four. The speed of the circuit increases on stages 2 and 5.

There are eight different enemy insects — a different insect is introduced on each of the first eight levels. Beginning on level 9, each level has four different enemies.

Unlike Pac-Man, the player can alter the layout of the maze by shifting any of the twenty green gates. It is not possible to completely isolate a portion of the maze through gate-shifting.

When the fourth enemy insect enters the maze, the central area will show a level-specific vegetable. Eating a vegetable gives the player bonus points and immobilizes the enemy insects for several seconds, though touching them is still lethal. The randomly placed skull icons are lethal to ladybugs and enemy insects. An enemy insect who dies returns to the central area. Once a vegetable is eaten, the central area will remain empty unless an enemy insect dies and is re-released, revealing a new vegetable. A ladybug who dies will shrink from view and be briefly replaced with icons resembling the stereotypical wings and halo of an angel.

The colors of the hearts and letters cycle through a short red, a middling yellow, and a longer blue. The point values are as follows:
Flower: 10 points (20, 30, or 50 points with appropriate multiplier)
Blue letter/heart: 100 points (200, 300, or 500 points with appropriate multiplier)
Yellow letter/heart: 300 points (600, 900, or 1500 points with appropriate multiplier)
Red letter/heart: 800 points (1600, 2400, or 4000 points with appropriate multiplier)
Vegetable: Starts at 1000 points, increases by 500 with each level to a maximum of 9500 points on level 18. Beyond this level, the vegetable's appearance (horseradish) and point value remain fixed.

If a heart is consumed while it is blue, a point multiplier will come into effect, indicated by the blue section in the upper right corner of the screen. The first blue heart doubles all point values, the second triples them and the third quintuples them. This multiplier lasts until the level is complete. Eating hearts while they are yellow or red offers no benefit beyond the points collected.

At each level, the maze will contain three letters. The first will be randomly selected from the set of {X, T, R} (which appear only in EXTRA), the second will be randomly selected from the set of {S, P, C, I, L} (which appear only in SPECIAL), and the third will be an A or an E (which appear in both words). A secondary goal of the player is to complete the words SPECIAL (indicated in red in the top left corner) and EXTRA (in yellow at top center). If, for example, a letter S is consumed while it is red, the corresponding letter in the word SPECIAL will change from grey to red. Eating an S while it is any other color (or if the S in SPECIAL is already red) offers no benefit beyond the points collected. Completing the word SPECIAL rewards the player with a free game, while completing EXTRA gives the player an extra life. Completing either word causes all its letters to return to normal and immediately advances the player to the next level.

The melodies that play when a new Lady Bug enters the maze, and when the player is awarded an extra Lady Bug, are snippets of a Japanese pop song called ""Ladybug Samba"" (てんとう虫のサンバ, Tentōmushi no Sanba)."

But don’t come into this one expecting just another Qix clone — this one actually does some notably different and interesting things. Land Breaker appeared in 2000 to relatively little fanfare; it’s barely acknowledged in the collective history of arcade games recorded across the Internet. That’s kind of a shame, though, because it provides an interesting twist on the usual “outline” formula. Yes, you’re still uncovering vaguely provocative images of scantily clad women — here provided in the form of low-resolution 65,536 colour digitised images — but the way in which you do so is notably different from other games of this type, such as Kaneko’s Gals Panic series. Instead of starting on the stage boundary and “cutting” into the stage as in Qix and its many, many clones, in Land Breaker you control a mechanical device which can freely move around the interior of the stage. By tapping one of the two buttons, you can switch it between a horizontal and vertical orientation, and by tapping the other button, you fire out a laser in both directions. If this laser reaches both sides of the available play area without being intercepted by something, it “cuts” the playfield, though the mildly lewd background is only actually uncovered if one of the slices you make contains no enemies whatsoever. In other words, if you cut the playfield in half, the half that has no enemies will reveal the backdrop, while the half that does contain enemies becomes the new available play area. But what happens if both slices contain enemies? In Qix, that was the main way in which you scored big points, largely because it was extremely difficult to achieve. But in Land Breaker, what happens is that you still create the “cut”, but neither slice reveals the background. The cut does act as a barrier for the enemies, however, so when dealing with large groups of enemies you can use this to corral them into gradually smaller and smaller areas, revealing the background a piece at a time with proper timing. The enemies mostly take the form of bouncing balls of various sizes. Towards the start of the game, you only have to deal with one or two large balls, but as the game progresses, you’ll have to deal with larger numbers of smaller balls, and occasional enemies that move in more unpredictable patterns."

"Lazarian","","Region Not Set","","Bally Mfg. Corp.","Bally | 																Midway","1981-01-01","2","No","Shooter","","The game consists of five distinct stages. In the first stage, the player is required to free several red ""meteors"" from their confinement zones in the center of the screen by shooting each zone when it turns yellow. Once all of the meteors have been freed, you must dock with a sister-ship in the center of the confinement zone and then destroy the meteors (which have now acquired the ability to fire back at you). During this stage, the circular confinement zone confines your movements to an area about three to four inches in diameter. Once all the meteors have been destroyed, you must traverse the ""Tunnel of Fear"", destroying various enemies as you try to dock with another sister-ship. After a successful docking, you must bore your way through the Lazarian's body to free the Evil Eye and then, finally, destroy the Evil Eye itself. Once the Eye is destroyed, you move on to the next round.

One of the odd aspects of gameplay is that although your ship can theoretically fire in all four directions, your actual firepower is arbitrarily limited in different ways for each stage. During the first meteor stage, you fire quick-moving laser beams, but during the second meteor stage your weapons become slow-moving ""bullets"". One or more of your firing directions becomes temporarily unavailable at different points during the ""Tunnel of Fear"". In the fourth stage, you have all four directions back, but your firing range is limited to about one inch away from your ship, requiring you to get dangerously close to the Lazarian to destroy it. In stage five, you're back to slow-moving bullets."

Plot
Ben and Norah, whose relationship is floundering, tour an island in Asia. However, they find that mutant giant animals are wreaking havoc, and they are desperate to escape. At the beginning of the tour, Ben appears nervous, while Norah attempts to calm him down. One of their guides is killed by a large tarantula, terrifying the both of them. They are then given FN FAL assault rifles with which to defend themselves against the spider swarms. Eventually, their vehicle crashes; however, before they can ask the driver what happened, the driver exits the vehicle and runs away in panic. They immediately discover why; a giant, purple tarantula has found them. They manage to escape it by driving their vehicle over a broken bridge, jumping over a cliffside in the process. Ben's map shows them that they have two options where to go next: a cave or a river.

If the player(s) choose the cave, Ben and Norah find a trio of survivors and escape the cave with them. One of the survivors claims that Ben and Norah are not helping them declares himself the leader, taking their guns. Before they can protest, a rescue helicopter arrives. Ben and Norah are temporarily given slingshots to defend themselves. Eventually, they reach the helicopter, but find it doesn't have enough room for them. The pilot informs them that there is another exctraction point in a nearby village from which they can evacuate the island, and they are given their guns back. As the helicopter takes off, they are attacked by a giant mantis. Upon killing the mantis, they discover that they are standing in front of a Buddha shrine, to which Norah comments, ""It really is mysterious Asia.""

If the player(s) choose the river, Ben and Norah ride a canoe down the river, attacked by poisonous tree frogs. At one point, they lose their guns in the river and have to use oars to defend themselves. Eventually, they retrieve their guns, and have to fight a giant mutant bullfrog. Upon killing the frog, they find a radio that tells anyone listening about a nearby village where they can escape via helicopter.

On the third stage (which is compulsory to play on), the player(s) travel through an abandoned village, only to be attacked by more tarantulas and mutated fleas, as they leave the village they are attacked by pillbugs. They must also travel across several stone pillars by pressing the button at the right time to avoid the attention of another large purple tarantula (Similar to the one seen on the first stage). They cross a river (due to the bridge being broken) and must fight off schools of mutated piranha fish, the tree frogs again, and several mutated crustaceans that resemble pond skaters. They hear a young boy calling for help and the player must use the buttons to help him save his elephant by hitting mutated fleas off its body. The boy then thanks them by letting them ride his elephant to the heli-pad, which will help them escape. On the way they encounter yet another tarantula, this time with mushrooms growing out of its back. The player fatally injures it but does not kill it, instead its falls off the cliff that they are on, into the sea.

The player then arrives at a Buddhist temple, the infected tarantula seen before returns and lunges at the player from above, when the player kills it, the tarantula falls to the Buddhist shrine and detonates several barrels of toxic waste in the process, causing an explosion that results in the lily plant pods around the shrine to become contaminated and grow teeth, they then merge into one giant mutant plant, which the player must fight. It is eventually defeated with help from the boy, who commands his elephant to kick a barrel of explosives at the plant, which the player must continuously shoot until it blows up and kills the plant.

In the cutscene, the boy thanks the players for their help and notes that he didn't help enough, so he gives Norah his good luck charm, which keeps bugs at bay. In the final cutscene, several butterflies land on the head of the Buddha statue (which is supposedly still contaminated) which leads to the events of the bonus stage.

In the course of their adventure, Ben and Norah learn the story behind the island. According to the boy of the island and a helicopter pilot, an environmental NGO called ""Green Leaves"", came to the island after it was devastated by war. Following the motto of ""bring back the green"", scientists of ""Green Leaves"" discovered a species of mushroom that possessed extraordinary biological regenerative properties. The scientists extracted and refined the mushrooms' essence, creating a powerful chemical extract that could accelerate biological growth. In cooperation with the island's natives, ""Green Leaves"" used the chemical extract to restore the island's fauna and flora within five years. However, it was later discovered that the extract's properties were too powerful, resulting in giant-sized animals, insects, and plants that have the capacity to harm humans. ""Green Leaves"" and many of the island's natives evacuated the island when events grew uncontrollable, although a number of natives decided to remain behind.

After finding the rescue helicopter, the two must battle with a mutated butterfly, and fall out of the helicopter during the fight. The two hang on to a rope ladder, and due to their guns falling to the ocean, they must use a slingshot to deliver the final blow. Depending on if the player(s) hit the creature or not, the couple will either make their relationship stronger and leave the island, or break up and escape, only to have their pilot infected with a mushroom."

"Libble Rabble","","Region Not Set","","Namco","Namco","1983-10-01","2","No","Action","Not Rated","Libble Rabble (Riburu Raburu) is an arcade game that was released by Namco in October 1983. It was designed by Toru Iwatani, who had also designed the Gee Bee series, Pac-Man, and Pole Position. It is a curious but challenging game, where the player tries to harvest little mushrooms (Mushlins) while avoiding various enemies, and was the first game from Namco to use a Motorola 68000 processor (which ran at 6.144 MHz).
 At first glance, the gameplay resembles Taito's Qix. The player controls two ""arrows"", one red (Libble) and one blue (Rabble) with a line strung between them. The object is to wrap the line around poles and surround Mushlins and enemies with it. The player can either close the loops themselves (worth more points for the Mushlins) or move both arrows to the same edge of the screen. The player clears a ""season"" when he or she harvests all the Mushlins.

Along the way, various enemies will appear and try to stop the player. The most common are four little hooded critters (Hobblins), which start each season in the corners. If the player catches them in a loop, they will be sent to the top of the screen for a short period of time. Other critters such as fireballs (Killers), sparks (Changers), and Demons will also appear. These can be killed by closing a loop around them. Sometimes, scissors-like enemies (Shears) appear, and if they cross the player's line, they cut it. If the player's line is ever cut by Shears or Demons, a new one is instantly made: directly between the two arrows.

Every so often when the player closes a line, a detector goes off indicating that the area he or she has closed off has a treasure chest somewhere. To actually uncover the chest, the player must surround a small enough area which covers just the chest, and no other possible hiding places. The game guides the player along that step, first by challenging him or her to uncover a chest at the start of the game (and then by revealing the locations of the chests for the first two seasons). When the player actually uncovers a chest, six bonus creatures (Topcups) will pop out, then make for the edges. The player must corral them with his or her line and then close the loop to score the bonus for them: they mean bonus letters. If the player manages to complete a bonus word, the season is automatically cleared out and the player moves to a bonus stage where he or she must try to uncover and collect chests (to collect a chest, the player needs to close a loop around an opened chest) within a time limit.

The player loses a life if any of the assorted critters touch one of the arrows or if he or she runs out of time (the border is the player's timer, and he or she can boost the time by looping Mushlins and plants), and the player gains an extra life at 40,000, 120,000, 200,000, 400,000, 600,000 and 1,000,000 points by default. After the 100th season, the season counter will stop at 99, similar to how Galaxian and King & Balloon's round indicators would stop after 48 rounds."

The first player controls Vic Viper and the second player takes the reins of debuting spacecraft Lord British, which is sometimes referred to as ""Road British"" due to the ambiguity of Japanese-to-English romanization. The game features six stages which alter between horizontal and vertical scrolling.

Players are allowed to continue from where they leave upon death instead of being returned to a predefined checkpoint as per Gradius tradition. There are no continues in Salamander's single player mode; however, in the two-player mode, players are given two continues. The number of continues can be changed through DIP switches. The player gains power-ups by picking up capsules left behind by certain enemies, as opposed to the selection bar used in other Gradius titles. However, the Japanese version of Life Force keeps the selection bar.

Many of the power-ups can be combined. For example, an option fires a second (or third) salvo of missiles or ripple/plutonic lasers if these power-ups have been option. The ripple and laser, however, are mutually exclusive. The only power-up that can survive the ship's destruction are the options. Upon the ship's destruction, the options float in space for a brief time before disappearing; the new ship can grab and retain them if they get to them first."

The game's 3rd level - the infamous 'lava' level - is another good example of Lifeforce's superb design; with huge solar flares constantly erupting both above and below the player's ship that must be carefully navigated to avoid instant loss of life.

"Luigi's Mansion Arcade","","Region Not Set","","Capcom","Capcom","2015-06-20","2","No","Shooter","E - Everyone","Luigi's Mansion Arcade (named Luigi Mansion Arcade in Japanese[1]) is an arcade game based off of Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon for the Nintendo 3DS. Developed and published by Capcom and released on the Sega Nu board, it is the fifth game to feature Luigi as the main character, and it is also one of the few Nintendo-based arcade games released in the current generation. It was revealed by Sega in early 2015[2], and was released in Japan during the summer of 2015. In the United States, like with Mario Kart Arcade GP DX, the game was tested at Dave & Buster's locations before receiving an official release across North America in spring 2017.[3][4]

The gameplay is a cross between the traditional Luigi's Mansion-styled mechanics and the rail shooter mechanics of a Light Gun game. The player cannot choose where to go, and is instead led through the mansions to encounter groups of ghosts, with the places and enemies based on those featured in Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon.

The controls involve a controller that is based on the Poltergust 5000. This controller has two buttons. Holding down the button on top charges up the Strobulb. Letting go unleashes a charge of light that open up safes and treasure chests and stun ghosts so that they can be sucked up. The button at the bottom lets the player suck up ghosts and vacuum certain objects that can release Coins. The lights in the arcade will darken once the player(s) begins the game.

To defeat a ghost, the player has to flash the ghosts with the Strobulb and then suck them up with the Poltergust 5000. If the player pulls the vacuum in the opposite direction of where the ghosts are fleeing, they can be sucked up for longer. Sucking a ghost for long enough fills up a meter. Pressing the Strobulb button at that point will perform a Power Surge that can deal big damage to the ghosts currently in the suction.

Sucking up multiple ghosts in a row increases a combo counter that increases the player's score and coin count. After getting a combo of at least two or more, collecting coins will also add to the combo count. The combo will eventually disappear and reset to zero if enough time passes without sucking up another ghost. If the player feels overwhelmed with the number of ghosts in the area, the player can press a green button to throw a Strobomb to stun all the ghosts with a Strobulb flash at once.

At certain points, the player will encounter missing objects in the environment. At this point, holding down the Strobulb button activates the Dark-Light Device. If the object is shone with the Dark-Light Device long enough, it will reappear.

If the player runs out of health, they will be able to choose to continue or not. If they choose to continue by entering their arcade card in the slot, pressing play again, and pressing the Strobomb button, they will return to the game with a Continue Boost, which increases the vacuum suction and Strobulb flash area, alongside getting two more Strobombs to use and having all of their health refilled.

Some arcade cabinets have the option to let players play an easier mode of the game, where the Strobulb, Dark-Light Device and Power Surge automatically activate without the push of a button. No penalty is put onto players who use this mode.

The game can be played with two people, the second player controlling a Luigi with inverted colors.[5]"

If he or she crashes, points are awarded based on the severity of the crash and sometimes the player receives a fuel penalty. In either case, the game starts another round with a different set of terrain and the player's remaining fuel. The game is over when the player has run out of fuel and crashes on the moon's surface."
"Lunar Rescue","","Region Not Set","","Taito Corporation","Taito Corporation","1979-10-01","2","No","Shooter","","The game starts with the player's spacecraft docked inside the mothership at the top of the screen. Below the mothership is an asteroid field and below that, the surface of the moon. There are three platforms which can be landed on and six stranded astronauts that need rescuing. You control a small spacecraft. The player must press the button to release their spacecraft from the mothership and manoeuvre through the asteroid field. The craft can only move left or right or use up a finite amount of fuel by engaging the thrust (the same button again) to slow its descent. If the craft is landed successfully on one of the available platforms, one of the astronauts will run towards and board the craft.

The asteroid belt now changes into a swarm of flying saucers, some of which drop bombs. The player must now guide the spacecraft back up to the mothership (the craft ascends without using up fuel), avoiding the flying saucers. The thrust button is now a fire button which can be used to shoot at enemies above (as in Space Invaders). Finally, the craft must be docked with the mothership using the bay opening. If the side of the mothership or any part of the ship outside of the opening is hit, the rescued astronaut falls to the surface and dies. If the mothership is missed altogether, the craft explodes. After all six people have been rescued (or killed providing the player still has lives remaining), the game starts again at a higher level."

Parts of its gameplay are taken from Mobile Suit Gundam: Bonds of the Battlefield, which also used the N2 P.O.D. system.
Mach Storm was released in December 2013 in Japan, and available internationally by February 2014.[1][2]

Mach Storm uses an special cabinet called P.O.D. (Panaromic Optical Display). The player flies as the flight lead of Storm Squadron in a COFFIN-equipped CFA-44 Nosferatu while battling enemy forces in locales across the world. The P.O.D. reacts to the user's actions, activating fans when flying at high speeds or vibrating the chair if the aircraft gets damaged. The aircraft is controlled with a flight stick for motion and a throttle control for acceleration and deceleration.

One credit (price dependent on location) allows the player to select any of the five available missions. After selecting a mission, the player permanently flies in a scripted path in Dogfight Mode, engaging and destroying enemy units. Bonuses are awarded for destroying enemies in quick succession, without getting damaged, and with gunfire. Like Dogfight Mode in Ace Combat: Assault Horizon, levels will include cinematic sequences like collapsing buildings and flying through cramped spaces.

If the player survives to the end of the mission, they will enter a timed boss encounter specific to the mission they're playing. If the boss is successfully destroyed, the player has the option to use another credit to play a bonus round to potentially double their score. The bonus round lasts for 60 seconds, but time can be extended by destroying certain enemies, and each kill will fill a gauge to use multi-lock missiles to gain more points.

At the end of the session, the player is ranked for their actions and placed on a local leaderboard."

The game is presented in a mixed perspective. The pre-shot perspective is a standard third-person view from just behind the golfer, but once the ball is hit, the view switches to a top-down perspective to track the ball in flight. The game takes a simplified approach to hitting the ball. Instead of setting the power and controlling the shot, the only function of the vertically oriented swing meter is to select the vertical angle of the shot, which, in turn, sets the amount of backspin/topspin applied to the ball. The strength of each swing is selected prior to the shot by setting a power gauge to one of 16 levels. Draw and fade can be applied to the ball by changing the players stance. However, the game specifies the maximum distance for the putter in yards (but measures distance on the greens in meters).

Players can choose to play as one of four golfers (power hitter, all-round player, technician, and magician). Each of these golfers possess a unique skill set that influences the player's ability to make certain types of shots.

The player controls a paintbrush, reddish-orange in color, and must paint the entire maze in order to advance to the next stage. Two fish — one yellow, the other light blue — emerge from separate aquariums to pursue the paintbrush around the board, and if either of the fish succeeds in making contact with the paintbrush, the player loses one of three lives (four if the player has attained a certain score, generally set at 10,000 points) — after which the paintbrush disappears momentarily, then over the next approximately eight seconds is replaced by what appears to be an reddish-orange cowboy hat with an arrow shot through it, while the machine plays the chorus of the ""Twelfth Street Rag,"" a hit song by Pee Wee Hunt in 1948.

The player may use two ""rollers"" to attack the fish. They are located on overpasses, one vertical in its orientation, the other horizontal. To use them, the player positions the paintbrush on its forward end, waits for either or both of the fish to approach, then pushes the paintbrush along the roller, attacking the fish. The fish is removed from the maze for a few seconds, then returns to one of the aquariums and resumes its pursuit of the paintbrush. Killing fish in this manner scores bonus points.

The fish initially are dumb, but as time goes on they get ""smarter"" learning to avoid the roller when the paintbrush nears it, and develop strategies to trap the player between them.

A third character, appearing to be an animal, rolling tire, or invisible man depending on the level, may enter the maze and leave tracks that must be painted over in order for the board to be completed. The player can limit the damage by running over the figure, which not only stops further tracks from being left but also awards the player a score, which progressively increases as more boards are cleared."

The player guides Mappy the police mouse through the mansion of the cats called Meowkies (Mewkies in Japan) to retrieve stolen goods, such as the Mona Lisa or a TV. The player uses a left-right joystick to move Mappy and a single button to operate doors. The mansion has six floors of hallways (four or five in some other versions) in which the stolen items are stashed. Mappy and the cats move between floors by bouncing on trampolines at various places in the house. Both Mappy and the cats can land on a floor on the way up, but not on the way down. When Mappy passes cats in the air, he is unharmed, but if he touches a cat he will lose a life. The trampolines break when Mappy bounces on them four times in a row, and the trampolines change color depending on how many times Mappy has used them without a rest. In addition to the Meowkies, the boss cat Goro (Nyamco in Japanese) also roams around. He is faster but less aggressive than the Meowkies. Throughout the levels, Goro hides behind the different recoverable items. If Mappy recovers an item which Goro is hiding behind, the player receives 1000 points in addition to the score for the item. Items come in pairs; retrieving the second item in a pair immediately after the first multiplies the point value of the second item (x2, up to x6).

Doors only open towards their doorknobs. Hitting a cat with a door scores 50 points and stuns the cat. Meowkies and Goro can open doors but will get stunned unless the door opens away from them (doorknobs away), and they can walk through opened doors. They cannot open blue doors. Blue doors, when opened, blast a slow moving microwave in the direction of the doorknob that will trap any cats it touches and remove them from the board when the wave reaches the edge of the screen. The more cats caught, the more points gained. If Goro is trapped by a wave, the score is doubled. Cats removed in this way return shortly from above.

A round is completed when all the loot is retrieved. If the player takes longer than usual to clear a round, a ""Hurry"" message appears after which the music speeds up and the cats move quickly and aggressively, and more Meowkies are added (two will appear ready to drop as the Meowkies normally do immediately following the ""Hurry"" message, and more Meowkies can arrive later on). If the player takes much longer after this, a green disc with Goro's face on it named the ""Gosenzo Coin"" will drop onto the top-middle platform and chase Mappy more effectively than the Meowkies as it can kill him while jumping. The Gosenzo can open doors and cannot be stopped by microwave doors or any objects.

The third round and every fourth round after is a bonus round. Mappy, unbothered by the cats, must bounce across a series of trampolines, popping fifteen different suspended red balloons (200 pts), with a ""Goro"" (2000 points) along the way. A bonus (5000 pts) is awarded if all the balloons are popped before the music ends. After every bonus round, a new feature is added to the gameplay, such as bells that freeze cats. The ""Hurry"" message will also appear sooner."

The only real complaint of fans was that the game was too short, with only six levels available to play. A longer, more involved sequel was desired, and this was put into development, with the result being Marble Man: Marble Madness II, planned for release in 1991.

This was a whole new game with new features, many more levels than the original, and a mascot character, Marble Man. The game was completed and several arcade cabinets were built for location testing, a first generation including the original Marble Madness trackball control, and a second generation featuring a more typical joystick control.

However, Atari found that the popularity of fighting games such as Street Fighter II were dominating the market. It seemed that the gameplay of Marble Madness was considered outdated and uncool, and so it was permanently shelved in favor of developing a new fighting game, Guardians of the Hood."

It was originally released to the Arcade before being ported to the PC Engine and Sharp X68000. It would also be added to the Japanese Wii's Virtual Console in 2009.

The Arcade and Sharp X68000 versions use an isometric view while the PC Engine uses a standard overhead view. The game's platforms are all suspended over a bottomless void. Alice can shoot bubbles, technically termed ""shabon balls"", at the enemy in an effort to knock them off of the floating terrain or destroy them. Holding down the attack button will charge the bubble and make it larger, resulting in greater knockback strength or simply more damage, depending on the enemy.

The enemies are also trying to knock Alice off, too. In fact, Alice does not take damage in a conventional sense: the only way to lose a life is to fall in to the void. Alice comes equipped with several balloons which can rescue her from a fall should one occur. Alice is capable of jumping to avoid obstacles or shots from enemies, or to jump over gaps in the terrain. At the end of each stage is a boss; Alice has a 180 second time limit to get to the end and defeat the boss or else ""time over"" monsters will appear and attack her.

Mario Bros. features two plumbers, Italian brothers Mario and Luigi, having to investigate the sewers after strange creatures have been appearing down there. The objective of the game is to defeat all of the enemies in each phase. The mechanics of Mario Bros. involve only running and jumping. Unlike future Mario games, players cannot jump on enemies and squash them, unless they were already turned on their back. Each phase is a series of platforms with pipes at each corner of the screen, along with an object called a ""POW"" block in the center. Phases use wraparound, meaning that enemies and players that go off to one side will reappear on the opposite side. The game has a point system, and continues until the player loses all lives.

Enemies are defeated by kicking them over once they have been flipped on their back. This is accomplished by hitting the platform the enemy is on directly beneath them. If the player allows too much time to pass after doing this the enemy will flip itself back over and recover.

There are four enemies which emerge from the pipes: the Shellcreeper; the Sidestepper; the Fighter Fly, which moves by jumping and can only be flipped when it is touching a platform; and the Slipice which turns platforms into slippery ice. A fifth enemy, fireballs, floats around the screen instead of sticking to platforms. ""POW"" blocks, which flips all enemies touching a platform or the floor when a player hits it from below, are also included. The game additionally contains bonus rounds."

Everything related with the Western world was killed or destroyed. Anyone against this principal was considered an enemy and accused of being bound with the devil. Dragon of Martial Master and Master Huang of Po Chi Lam could not accept these outrageous actions so they band together in order to prevent much bloodshed.
One day the leader of White Lotus Sect sent an invitation to Dragon and Master Huang but Dragon's disciples saw this as a trap and recommended that they wait for Master Huang, who was out of town collecting medicine. The Master did not want to miss this opportunity to make peace and went alone. Unfortunately, he was captured and put in prison. Both parties started confrontations and have struggled since then.

At the start the player chooses one of ten superhero Kamen Riders (Rider 1, Rider 2, Rider V3, Riderman, Rider X, Amazon, Stronger, Super1, Rider 2X or Black RX).

The rider moves forward automatically at a constant speed. The game is fast-paced and the rider needs to dodge obstacles that slow him down, while using a close-ranged melee weapon to take out enemies to earn points or clear the way. There are bottlenecks and large horizontal obstacles such as passing traffic or a shark lying on a beach. Dash patches provide boosts and there are jumps to pass through the air for a few seconds. Both of these provide a permanent speed boost over the default speed and last until there is contact with an obstacle or a surface that slows down the rider. Contact with enemies or obstacles depletes a horizontal fuel meter at the bottom of the left screen. The bottom left corner of the screen holds the speed meter. At the end of each level a score is calculated based on the remaining time and fuel, and a bonus for not missing anything.

While enemies, innocents, and explosions are 2D digitized video sprites, the levels and vehicles are pre-rendered in 3D.

The player(s) play the role of an unnamed counter-terrorist agent who engages in three major combat zones: a cargo ship at a dock, a large bank, and a jungle. The first two zones can be played in any order. These areas are under siege by terrorists and the player must kill the terrorists before they take aim and fire at the player character. Shooting hostages or getting shot by terrorists causes the player to lose lives. After four hits are taken, the player must refill their credits or the game is over.

There are several power-ups in the game, such as rapid-fire mode (which is indicated by a spinning assault rifle bullet) for the player's gun or a powerful single-shot mode (which is indicated by a spinning shotgun shell). Shooting windows, barrels, cars, and other objects increases the player's score.

If they reach the bottom of the screen, they will start hopping towards your spacepod if they catch your spacepod, they'll eat it. In these rounds, your spacepod fires in three directions simultaneously straight up, and 45 degrees to either side. The eight types of monsters shown in the score table attack in the order shown for the first eight waves (i.e. wave 1 is all 100-point monsters, wave 2 is all 200-point monsters, etc.) wave nine is a mass attack of all eight types, and waves ten and up are randomly-chosen from the first nine types. Each space monster round contains a total of 25 monsters, though only eight will be on the screen at any one time.

The second half of the wave starts out with a spinning space ring that drifts around the screen, growing in size if you shoot it, it splits into two smaller rings that go off in different directions and start growing again. If any ring reaches sufficient size, it will ""tractor-beam"" your spacepod into its center (your controls are frozen at this point) and then crush it. In this round, your spacepod only fires straight up the two 45-degree guns are disabled. The rings are worth the same number of points as the monsters in the first half of the waves.

MEGATACK has a somewhat confusing way of indicating how many spacepods you have left. The number in the center of each pod is not a remaining lives indicator rather, it is the serial number of each pod, starting at three (or four) and descending towards one. This number does not change if you earn bonus pods rather, all of your bonus pods are numbered ""0"". Neither does the ""x spacepods remaining"" message that flashes briefly across the screen at the start of each player/pod's turn accurately reflect bonus pods rather, once you have exhausted your three standard pods, the game will repeatedly announce bonus spacepod and continue playing until you use up however many bonus pods you manage to accumulate."

The arcade version of the game had up to three players available for play. The players are members of a covert mercenary team known as the ""Wolf Force"". The team is composed of Joseph Gibson (Player 1 in blue), Howard Powell (Player 2 in red), and Thomas Clarke (Player 3 in yellow). Their objective is to rescue a former President from rebels in the fictional African country of Zutula, which is administered by an apartheid government. The game has six levels, plus the final level where the objective is to rescue the president from the Hercules Transport.

The controls consist of an eight-directional joystick and two buttons: a Normal Attack and the Megacrush Attack. The player character has a vitality gauge which will gradually deplete as they take damage from enemies, however First-Aid Kits can be picked up that will restore part of the player's energy, as well as power-ups that increases their maximum vitality. The player can upgrade their default gun into an Assault Rifle, a Shotgun, a Grenade Launcher, or a Flamethrower. The Megacrush button will detonate a bomb that kills all on-screen enemies.

It is both ""Project Gun Frontier 2"" and ""Darius III""; the game was developed by the Gun Frontier team, and ties to the original Darius development still exist.

Players control the Black Fly on their mission to defeat the forces of Nemesis in hopes of saving the human race. Players collected many small power-ups to build their weapon's power. Players could then unleash a large beam attack that would drain their power level back to zero. Bosses could also collect these power-ups and use similar beam attacks. When a player's beam collided with a bosses, it would culminate in a spectacular reaction before the more powerful attack would push the weaker down.

The year is 2042: A companion star of the planet Jupiter appears a few Astronomical Units away from the planet and not long before its discovery propels the asteroids along Jupiter's orbit which sends a wave of meteorites towards the Earth. As the Earthlings struggled to survive, extraterrestrial cybernetic invaders from beyond the distant star used the meteorites as cover for invading Earth with little resistance, intending to plunder Earth for inorganic materials needed to sustain their forms. Both the aliens and the star they came from were quickly dubbed 'Nemesis.'

What resistance the aliens did face from Earth's combined international defense forces were quickly obliterated by the alien's powerful beam weapons. Earth's scientists studied the molecules that powered the alien's weaponry which started to litter the Earth and called the molecule 'Newalone.' With Newalone in their hands, scientists quickly began Project Metal Black, which focused on developing at least twenty-thousand human space craft capable of wielding the same beam-weaponry as the aliens. The space craft was known as the CF-345 Black Fly, named by its method of Newalone energy use.

However, ten years after the invasion, Earth's remaining diplomats passed a treaty on to the aliens under a peaceful surrender, which promised to keep all of Earth's remaining forces from attacking: This applied to Project Metal Black which sealed the Black Fly space craft from the people. The Earth's natural resources were dying and the planet's population was thinning... it was only a matter of time until someone discovered Metal Black"

Millipede is the sequel to the 1981 arcade video game, Centipede.

The player no longer takes the role of the ""Bug Blaster"" from Centipede, but instead takes the role of an elf called the ""Archer"". The object of the game is to destroy a millipede that advances downward from the top of the screen. The millipede travels horizontally until it either hits an obstacle or reaches the edge of the screen, after which it drops one row and reverses direction. Once it enters the player's gray maneuvering area, it stays there and extra heads appear at intervals until both they and the millipede are destroyed. Shooting a body segment splits the millipede in two, with the rear portion sprouting its own head. A collision with any enemy costs the player one life.

Differences from Centipede
According to the game's arcade flyer and instruction manual, the game's storyline involves the player character, Archer, defending his mushroom forest from the onslaught of gigantic insect monsters using his magic arrows.
The millipede moves faster and its head segment is more difficult to hit.
Earwigs replace scorpions from Centipede, making mushrooms poisonous so that the millipede will charge straight to the bottom of the screen after touching them.
Bees replace fleas from Centipede, leaving mushrooms in a vertical line and requiring two shots to destroy.
Spiders behave the same way as in Centipede, moving in zig-zag pattern across the player area and eating mushrooms. Multiple spiders can appear at the same time on higher levels.
Inchworms move horizontally across the screen and slow all enemies for a short period of time when hit.
Ladybugs crawl around the player area for a while, then climb up and leave the screen, turning any mushrooms they touch into indestructible flowers. When hit, all mushrooms on the screen scroll down one row.
Dragonflies drop mushrooms while zig-zagging down.
Mosquitoes bounce off the sides of the screen as they descend diagonally. When hit, all mushrooms on the screen scroll up one row.
DDT bombs are triggered when shot, destroying all enemies and mushrooms within the resulting cloud. Whenever the mushrooms scroll down, a new bomb is added at the top of the screen, with up to four bombs in play at one time. Points are scored for shooting the bomb itself, and enemies destroyed in the blast are worth three times the normal points.

All flowers and poisoned or partially destroyed mushrooms revert to normal, whole mushrooms and score points during the process when the player loses a life.

At regular intervals, the player enters a bonus level with a swarm of enemies (bees, dragonflies, etc.) instead of the usual millipede. Each enemy awards increasing points, up to a maximum of 1,000 points per enemy. The attack ends when either the entire swarm has passed or the player loses a life. Also, at intervals new mushrooms will grow on the field while others disappear, in a pattern similar to Conway's Game of Life.

Players can choose whether to play at an advanced level, starting with a score that is a multiple of the number of points needed to earn an extra life (by default, 15,000). The gameplay is generally much more advanced than it would be had the player started with a score of 0 and worked their way up to that point level. The maximum advanced level allowed is a function of the preceding player's score, and games started at an advanced level where the player did not earn at least one extra life are not eligible for the high scoreboard."

The game is played by moving a crosshair across the sky background via a trackball and pressing one of three buttons to launch a counter-missile from the appropriate battery. Counter-missiles explode upon reaching the crosshair, leaving a fireball that persists for several seconds and destroys any enemy missiles that enter it. There are three batteries, each with ten missiles; a battery becomes useless when all its missiles have been launched or if it is destroyed by enemy fire, whichever occurs first. The missiles of the central battery fly to their targets at much greater speed; only these missiles can effectively kill a smart bomb at a distance.

The game is staged as a series of levels of increasing difficulty; each level contains a set number of incoming enemy weapons. The weapons attack both the cities and the missile batteries and can destroy any target with one hit. Enemy weapons are only able to destroy three cities during one level. A level ends when all enemy weaponry is destroyed or reaches its target. A player who runs out of missiles no longer has control over the remainder of the level. At the conclusion of a level, the player receives bonus points for all remaining missiles and cities; at preset score intervals, the player earns a bonus city that can be used to replace a destroyed one at the end of the current level. These bonus cities can be kept in reserve and are automatically deployed as needed. The scoring multiplier begins at 1x and advances by 1x after every second level, to a maximum of 6x; this multiplier affects both target and bonus values.

The game inevitably ends once all six cities are destroyed and the player neither has any in reserve nor earns one during the current level. Like most early arcade games, there is no way to ""win""; the enemy weapons become faster and more prolific with each new level. The game, then, is just a contest in seeing how long the player can survive. On conclusion of the game, the screen displays ""The End"", rather than ""Game Over"", signifying that ""In the end, all is lost. There is no winner"". This conclusion is skipped, however, if the player makes the high score list and the game prompts the player to enter their initials."

Players can select from 12 mobile suits: returning from the first game are the Federation's Gundam and Zeon's Zaku, Gouf, Dom and Gelgoog, the amphibious Z'Gok, as well as Char Aznable variations of Zaku, Gelgoog and Z'Gok. Sayla Mass' alternate Gundam is replaced by the Guncannon, and the game also adds Zeon's Gyan and Acguy. Each suit again features its own arena, based on locations and situations from the TV series. Many are all-new, others are just touched up from the first game. Each character also has its own ending sequence.

Single-player mode consists of 14 consecutive fights:12 against the standard suits (including a mirror match) plus 2 against secret boss enemies. The last boss suit and its pilot are not based on the TV series but were especially designed for the game. It is possible to unlock the two bosses for player selection. Two-player mode allows match-ups in all combinations: both players can select the same character.

The actual fights follow the standard best-of-three model, with the backgrounds changing slightly in each round. Controls involve the joystick and four buttons: three for light, medium and heavy attacks and one for throws (throws can also be triggered by the attack buttons). Every suit has three to four special moves (usually involving ranged weapons) triggered by input combinations, most of them requiring ""Hadouken""-style circling movements with the joystick, then pressing an attack button."

The game features 8 different types of ""blocks"": 6 types based on Japanese coinage and 2 special blocks. Coins of the same denomination can be chained to convert them to coins of higher value; for example, if you place two 5 yen coins next to each other they will become a 10 yen coin, while 5 10 yen coins will convert to a 50 yen coin. This pattern continues up to 500 yen coins; two five-hundred yen coins placed next to each other will disappear, helping to clear the player's side and pushing down the coins on the opponent's side.

At the end of a stage, that time spent is compared to the average, and bonus points are awarded accordingly, at 1,000 plus 100 per second bettered; completing an entire course gives an additional 5,000 points plus 100 per second bettered. There are two unique courses: the ""Beginner Course"" and the ""Champion Course"". The Champion Course ""loops"" forever, and each loop is numbered for convenience, up to three.

Kahn agrees to this plan, and even restores Tsung's youth. He then extends the invitation to Raiden, who gathers his warriors and takes them into Outworld. The new tournament is much more dangerous, as Shao Kahn has the home field advantage, and an Outworld victory will allow him to subdue Earthrealm."

"Mr. Do!","","NTSC-U","United States of America","Universal U.S.A., Inc.","Universal Entertainment Corporation","1982-12-05","2","No","Action","E - Everyone","Mr. Do! is a 1982 arcade video game developed by Universal and released by Universal USA in the USA on December 5, 1982.

Mr. Do! is the first video game in the Mr. Do! series.

The object of Mr. Do! is to score as many points as possible by digging tunnels through the ground and collecting cherries. The title character, Mr. Do (a circus clown—except for the original Japanese version of the game, in which he is a snowman), is constantly chased by red dinosaur-like monsters called creeps, and the player loses a life if Mr. Do is caught by one. The game ends when the last life is lost.

Cherries are distributed throughout the level in groups of eight, and collecting all the cherries in one group without a pause awards bonus points. A level is complete either when all cherries are removed, all creeps are destroyed, ""EXTRA"" is spelled, or a diamond is found.

Mr. Do can defeat creeps by hitting them with his bouncing ""power ball"" or by dropping large apples on them. While the power ball is bouncing toward a creep, Mr. Do is defenseless. If the ball bounces into an area where there are no creeps to hit (such as behind a fallen apple), Mr. Do cannot use it again until he has retrieved it. When the power ball hits a creep, it then reforms in Mr. Do's hands after a delay that increases with each use.

Mr. Do or the creeps can push an apple off the edge of a vertical tunnel and crush one or more creeps. If an apple falls more than its own height, it breaks and disappears. Mr. Do can also be crushed by a falling apple, causing a loss of life.

Occasionally, the creeps transform briefly into more powerful multicolored monsters that can tunnel through the ground. If one of these digs through a cherry, it leaves fewer cherries for Mr. Do to collect. When it digs under an apple, it often crushes itself, other creeps, and/or Mr. Do.

As the game progresses, a display at the top of the screen cycles through the letters in the word EXTRA. Every time the player's score reaches a multiple of 5,000 points, the highlighted letter enters the playfield as an Alphamonster, which can be defeated in the same manner as a creep. Defeating the Alphamonster awards its letter; collecting all five letters ends the level, plays a cut scene accompanied by the theme to Astro Boy, and awards the player an extra life. Alphamonsters attempt to eat any apples they encounter, which makes them difficult to crush.

The creeps spawn at the center of the screen. After they have all appeared, the generator will turn into a food item; picking this up scores bonus points, freezes all the creeps, and calls out an Alphamonster (if one is not already on the field) and three large blue monsters. The latter can eat apples as well. The creeps stay frozen until the player either defeats all three blue monsters, defeats the Alphamonster (in which case any remaining blue monsters are turned into apples), loses a life, or completes the stage.

Rarely, dropping an apple reveals a diamond which, if collected, completes the level and awards a bonus credit to the player."
"Mr. Do's Castle","","NTSC-U","United States of America","Universal U.S.A., Inc.","Universal Entertainment Corporation","1983-10-01","2","No","Platform","E - Everyone","Mr. Do's Castle is a 1983 arcade video game developed by Universal and released by Universal USA in the USA on October 1, 1983.

Mr. Do's Castle is the second video game in the Mr. Do! series.

The object of Mr. Do's Castle is to score as many points as possible by collecting cherries and/or defeating unicorn-like monsters. The game takes place in a castle filled with platforms and ladders —reminiscent of Space Panic (1980)—some of which can be flipped from one platform to another, much like a kickstand on a bicycle. The player controls Mr. Do as he collects cherries by using a hammer to knock out blocks that contain them from the various platforms. Empty holes left by the knocked-out blocks serve as traps for the monsters —if a monster falls into a hole, the player can then defeat it by causing a block above the monster to fall on top of it (and additional points are scored if such a monster falls multiple levels en route to its destruction). If the player takes too long to complete a level, the monsters transform into faster, more difficult forms —at first green in color, later blue —that rapidly multiply once they turn blue. The game advances to the next level when all cherries on the level have been collected or all enemies have been defeated. The player loses a life if Mr. Do is caught by a monster, and the game ends when the player runs out of lives.

As in Mr. Do!, the player can earn an extra life by collecting all of the letters from the word ""EXTRA"". Regular monsters can be changed into monsters bearing the EXTRA letters by collecting all three keys distributed around the playfield and then picking up a magic shield from the top floor. Monsters in this state are easier to defeat than normal; a simple hammer strike will do the job. After a brief interval, they change back into their normal forms. The game also offers a bonus credit for collecting a rare diamond that appears on the playfield at random intervals.

The cherry blocks are absent from Mr. Do! Vs. Unicorns and early revisions of Mr. Do's Castle. Instead, blocks that are not keys or skulls at the start of a stage will be fill blocks (those left behind when unicorns fall into holes and are left alone for a time). Because of this, there are only three ways to complete a level in this version, versus the four ways to complete levels in Mr. Do's Castle. In addition, in these early revisions, the fill blocks change colors every two stages."

Mr. Do's scenario is a roller coaster, and the object is to reach the top. As the cars (and eventually other objects) speed around the track, the player must escape by using a super speed button, or by climbing up small ladders scattered about the track to dodge the hazards. Two icons at the end of the level range from cakes to EXTRA letters or diamonds change upon collecting cherries at the top of each letter. The game is timed, and the timer ticks faster when the super speed button is held down. Collision with a roller coaster car or another object is fatal, knocking Mr. Do off the coaster and costing a life.

After the sixth level is completed, the game cycles back to the first with various obstacles and/or more roller coaster cars to avoid."

Controlling one of seven characters, players must make it to the bottom of the level by destroying colorful formations of blocks. G introduces several new ideas to the series, such as power-ups, a story campaign, and online multiplayer.

The game was developed by Project Driller, the nickname given to Namco's Creative Department #2. Production was headed by series producer Hideo Yoshizawa and Yasuhito Nagaoka. G was intended as the last game in the series, leading to the addition of a larger cast of characters and proper introduction to the in-game world. It was also designed to bridge connections with Dig Dug, an older Namco arcade game that served as inspiration for Mr. Driller. The soundtrack was composed by Go Shiina, featuring a distinct mix of acid house and jazzy J-Pop compositions.

Mr. Driller G performed well in arcades, leading to a home release on the PlayStation the same year. The game was well-received both at release and retrospectively, and is cited as one of the best games in the series. Reviewers praised its visual presentation, amount of content, soundtrack, and additions to the gameplay of its predecessors.

Ms. Pac-Man is the second game in the Pac-Man series and the first game in the Pac-Man series to be developed without Namco's involvement.

The gameplay is very similar to that of Pac-Man. The player earns points by eating pellets and avoiding ghosts (contact with one causes Ms. Pac-Man to lose a life). Eating an energizer (or ""power pellet"") causes the ghosts to turn blue, allowing them to be eaten for extra points. Bonus fruits can be eaten for increasing point values, twice per round. As the rounds increase, the speed increases, and energizers generally lessen the duration of the ghosts' vulnerability, eventually stopping altogether.

Differences from the original Pac-Man
The game has four mazes that appear in different color schemes and alternate after each of the game's intermissions are seen. The pink maze appears in levels one and two; the light blue maze appears in levels three, four, and five; the brown maze appears in levels six to nine; and the dark blue maze appears in levels 10 to 14. After level 14, the maze configurations alternate every fourth level.
The first, second, and fourth mazes have two sets of warp tunnels, as opposed to only one in the original maze.
The walls have a solid color rather than an outline, which makes it easier for a novice player to see where the paths around the mazes are.
The orange ghost is called Sue, rather than Clyde; her color was later changed to purple in Pac-Land to differentiate her.
The ghosts' behavioral patterns are different, and include semi-random movement, which prevents the use of patterns to clear each round. Blinky (red) and Pinky (pink) move randomly in the first several seconds of each level, until the first reversal. Inky (cyan) and Sue (orange) still use the same movement patterns from the previous game to their respective corners, again until the first reversal.
Instead of appearing in the center of the maze, the fruits bounce around the maze, entering and (if not eaten) leaving through the warp tunnels. Once all fruit has been encountered, they appear in random sequence for the rest of the game, starting on the eighth round; a 5000-point banana can be followed by a 100-point pair of cherries.
When Ms. Pac-Man makes contact with a ghost and dies, she spins around, or as the back of the flier says, ""she dramatically swoons and falls"" rather than folding in on herself as the original Pac-Man did.
The three intermissions follow the developing relationship between the original Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man (from when they first meet to having a stork drop off their baby). The latter served as the basis for Baby Pac-Man and is referenced in Jr. Pac-Man.
The slowdown applied to the ghosts in the warp tunnels only applies for the first three rounds in this game.
The sound effects and music are all new."

Collecting one of these will shift the section cursor along the weapon bar at the bottom of the screen. The player can then select the weapon highlighted if they want it. The cursor then resets. In general, the more useful 'power ups' are towards the right hand side of the bar, so the player may decide to stock up on pickups until the better item is available.

Game Play

You control a tank with a hall effect joystick. The tank can move in 8 directions. The fire button causes the tank to shoot in the direction it is moving. On each screen, there are active and dormant enemy tanks. As the screens progress, the tanks are worth more and more, but the dormant tanks are always worth twice as much as the active ones. Of course they are well guarded! The scenery consists of a few trees and a river which you can only cross by bridge. If you shoot an active tank, one of the dormant tanks will spring to life and come after you. The object of the game is to clear the level and go on to the next one before they kill you. Each succeeding level has more enemies, and moves faster and faster. The game plays a tune at the start of each level, and then there is a JAWS-like tune that it plays as you play. As the battle gets more and more frantic, so does the music. The tank makes a simple but interesting sound that is unique to this game.

"Oh My God!","","Region Not Set","","Atlus Co., Ltd.","Atlus Co., Ltd.","1993-12-01","2","No","Puzzle","","Oh My God! was Atlus' entry into arcade puzzle games. Coming out in 1993, it was their third arcade game, after the shooter BlaZeon and the fighting game Power Instinct. While BlaZeon and Power Instinct were released in countries other than Japan, Oh My God! was never released anywhere else. Part of it could be that the word ""God"" is in the title, which some people could have found offensive back in 1993.

Oh My God! is a drop style puzzle game, where you control chains of falling ball creatures. You can move the chains up down, and side to side, but you can't make them go through where another ball is, making it kind of like the classic game Snake. The goal is to line three or more balls of the same color in a row, making the balls disappear. Rows can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. Not all rows will be apparent while maneuvering your chain of balls, so if you have a row lined up, you can see the ball creatures making terrified faces below. If you take too long, the chain will fall faster and eventually lock in place. You can also hit a button to instantly drop the chain where it is, which is extremely useful.

Things get trickier, though. On the side of the screen, you can see little ball creatures slowly crawling up a slope and into a huge urn. Your chains come from that urn, and once that ball falls in, your chains will be one ball longer. This makes maneuvering chains much more complicated. There is an advantage to this, though. If your chain has three balls of the same color inside it, you can line them up while they're still in the air. The game always tells you when this happens and will tell you exactly the right way to position your chain in the air. If you can do this, your remaining balls will fall and turn all balls in a vertical row to that color, eliminating it, and possibly some others that were bordering it. Your chain count will also reset back to three. You can also level up by clearing a certain number of balls, which will also reset your chains back down to three. Multipliers are also awarded by having balls fall into more balls and make subsequent three in a row lines.

If your balls end up filling the screen so much that you cannot drop them, the game ends, and you hear a voice clip of an audience shouting ""Oh My God!"" while any ball creatures climbing into the urn smile and put on sunglasses. This partially ties into the story, which involves challenging God. How this involves gameplay is never explained, though the resulting backgrounds are pretty cool. Backgrounds change every 3 levels, all of them having vague biblical themes such as a temple with glowing clouds above it, an idol to the ball monsters, or Earth being destroyed by huge green pillars. Oh My God! never takes any of this seriously, always having a lighthearted feel to it. It is notable that this is not the first time God has been a main antagonist in an Atlus game. He's one of the possible final bosses in Megami Tensei.

2-player mode changes the story and gameplay a little. Instead of challenging God, you're trying to amuse him by challenging another player. You also dump extra balls on your opponent for scoring combos, similar to Tetris Attack or Super Puzzle Fighter II. The extra balls can fill up your opponent's screen, but it could provide him with an advantage if they really know how to use their chains right, making gameplay very back and forth. It's very satisfying to have your friend think he's winning because your screen is nearly full, until you unload a huge combo on him and win from out of nowhere.

Even though Oh My God! is very fun and addictive, puzzle games don't get a lot of respect or recognition anymore, and understandably so too. Today, they're mostly associated with shovelware, poorly put together flash games, and shallow gameplay. The target audiences for such games are usually not the hardcore crowd, but casual gamers. If you're willing to look past some of its inherent differences from normal hardcore games, Oh My God! can deliver a more than enjoyable experience and prove to be one of the better creative games of its type."

The game is also known as the second ever vertical shoot 'em up game, after Taito's Space Invaders (which ran on the same arcade hardware), but is also additionally known as the first game with disparate ""levels"". The game is also notable for being the first action game to feature a supply of energy, resembling a life bar, a mechanic that has now become common in the majority of modern action games. The game allowed the player to refuel energy between each level, and it featured a large variety of alien enemies.

The player controls a space craft which must fend off UFOs, meteors, and comets. Instead of lives, the player is given an energy reserve that is constantly diminishing; getting hit by the enemy causes gameplay to stop momentarily and a large amount of energy is depleted. Every so often, a mothership will appear and dock with the player's spacecraft, allowing the energy to be refilled. There are 3-4 recognizable stages as the game progresses and new enemies begin to appear. After these, the mothership will appear, and the cycle starts over; this continues indefinitely until the energy reaches zero.

There are two known bootleg versions of this game called Space Phantoms and Solar Flight. In Space Phantoms the player's ship looks like an angel, and the enemies appear as different types of insects. Due to the game being monochrome and a conversion kit for Space Invaders, many Ozma Wars monitors still utilized the Space Invaders color overlay."

Pac & Pal is the sixth game in the Pac-Man series and the third game in the Pac-Man series to be developed by Namco in Japan.

Controls consist of a four-position joystick and a button. Using the joystick, the player guides Pac-Man through an enclosed maze in which several items are locked behind doors. Several face-down cards are scattered throughout the maze; when Pac-Man runs over one of these, it flips over to reveal one of the items, which becomes unlocked so Pac-Man can eat it. Two items in each maze are power-ups, which correspond to ""S"" cards. Upon eating one of these, Pac-Man temporarily turns blue and grows larger; the player can now press the button to fire a beam that briefly stuns the ghosts. Items include a flagship from Galaxian, a red car from Rally-X, a trumpet, a snowman, and a miniature Pac-Man. The items are simply different cosmetically, and all of them have the same effect.

Assisting Pac-Man is the titular ""Pal"" character Miru, a green-colored creature with a pink bow. Whenever any items are unlocked, Miru will try to pick one up and carry it toward the center box; if Pac-Man does not catch up to her and eat the item before she enters the box, it disappears. Once all the items are gone, the level ends and the player earns bonus points for each item eaten, receiving a larger bonus for preventing Miru from taking any of them into the box. An orange area immediately below the center box causes the ghosts to slow down whenever they are inside and obscures both them and Pac-Man, leaving only the ghosts' eyes visible. The third level and every fourth level thereafter is a bonus stage with 10 cards and no ghosts; one card shows Miru, one shows the ghost Blinky, and the other eight have dollar signs. Points are awarded for each card flipped, and Miru's card doubles the total. The stage ends immediately if Blinky is found, but the player earns a larger bonus for finding him last. The player loses one life whenever Pac-Man touches a non-stunned ghost, but can safely run through Miru at any time. When all lives are lost, the game ends."

Pac-Land is the ninth game in the Pac-Man series and the fourth game in the Pac-Man series to be developed by Namco in Japan.

Controlling Pac-Man, the player is tasked with reaching the end of each level while avoiding enemies and other obstacles. Stages are known in-game as ""trips"" and are broken into four sections — the first three have Pac-Man running to return a lost fairy back to ""Fairyland"", and the last having Pac-Man return home to his family. Pressing either of the directional buttons will make Pac-Man walk in that direction, and repeatedly tapping either button will make him run. Pac-Man can also jump over pits and obstacles by pressing the jump button.

In each stage, Pac-Man will encounter the four ghosts from the original game — Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde — alongside a purple ghost named Sue, originally a replacement for Clyde in Ms. Pac-Man. Eating large flashing Power Pellets will cause the ghosts to turn blue for a short time, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points. The ghosts are often seen driving vehicles, such as airplanes, buses, cars, pogo-sticks, and flying saucers, and will sometimes drop miniature ghost enemies from the air to try and hit Pac-Man. Other types of obstacles are also present in stages, such as water-spewing fire hydrants, springboards, falling logs, quicksand, and geysers.

Trips consist of cities, forests, deserts, and abandoned castles. Most trip sections end with a large sign saying ""BREAK TIME"" with a church on a hill in the background, and bonus points are awarded for jumping at certain points at the end of each section. The final section of a trip gives Pac-Man a special pair of boots that will allow him to jump infinitely into the air, and tasks the player with returning home to Pac-Man's family. The player can find hidden items by pushing against specific objects in certain stages, including a helmet that protects Pac-Man from falling mini ghosts, an item that makes Pac-Man temporarily invincible, and a Galaxian flagship that awards the player a large sum of points. Jumping in certain spots will reveal fruit items that can be consumed for points.

The game features the theme song from the Pac-Man cartoon series, which plays in a constant loop throughout. The North American version of the game by Midway features the characters being re-designed to more closely resemble the designs found in the show, while the Japanese Namco version has the characters modeled after Pac-Man marketing material and cabinet artwork.

When all lives have been lost, the game ends. Pac-Man is awarded a single bonus life at 10,000 points by default. Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as power pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter as the game progresses. In later stages, the enemies go straight to flashing, bypassing blue, which means that they can only be eaten for a short amount of time, although they still reverse direction when a power pellet is eaten; in even later stages, the ghosts do not become edible (i.e., they do not change color and still make Pacman lose a life on contact), but they still reverse direction."

Pac-Man is the first game in the Pac-Man series and the first game in the Pac-Man series to be developed by Namco in Japan.

The player controls Pac-Man through an enclosed maze. The objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts—Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange)—who pursue Pac-Man. When Pac-Man eats all of the dots, the player advances to the next level. Levels are indicated by fruit icons at the bottom of the screen. In between levels are short cutscenes featuring Pac-Man and Blinky in humorous, comical situations.

If Pac-Man is caught by a ghost, he loses a life; the game ends when all lives are lost. Each of the four ghosts has its own unique artificial intelligence (A.I.), or ""personality"": Blinky gives direct chase to Pac-Man; Pinky and Inky try to position themselves in front of Pac-Man, usually by cornering him; and Clyde switches between chasing Pac-Man and fleeing from him.

Placed near the four corners of the maze are large flashing ""energizers"" or ""power pellets"". When Pac-Man eats one, the ghosts turn blue with a dizzied expression and reverse direction. Pac-Man can eat blue ghosts for bonus points; when a ghost is eaten, its eyes make their way back to the center box in the maze, where the ghost ""regenerates"" and resumes its normal activity. Eating multiple blue ghosts in succession increases their point value. After a certain amount of time, blue-colored ghosts flash white before turning back into their normal forms. Eating a certain number of dots in a level causes a bonus item—usually a fruit—to appear underneath the center box; the item can be eaten for bonus points. To the sides of the maze are two ""warp tunnels"", which allow Pac-Man and the ghosts to travel to the opposite side of the screen. Ghosts become slower when entering and exiting these tunnels.

The game increases in difficulty as the player progresses: the ghosts become faster, and the energizers' effect decreases in duration, eventually disappearing entirely. An integer overflow causes the 256th level to load improperly, rendering it impossible to complete."

Pac-Man Plus is the third game in the Pac-Man series and the second game in the Pac-Man series to be developed without Namco's involvement.

The gameplay in Pac-Man Plus is nearly identical to that of the original Pac-Man. The player controls Pac-Man and attempts to score as many points as possible by eating all the Pac-Dots in the maze while avoiding the four ghosts that chase him around the maze and will kill him if they catch him. Eating a Power Pellet will cause the ghosts to turn blue and become vulnerable for a short period of time, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for extra points. Once the maze has been cleared, it will be refilled as the gameplay continues.

The most noticeable differences between the original game and Plus are various tweaks to the graphics: the maze is green instead of blue, vulnerable ghosts are shorter and have a stem and leaf sticking out of their heads, the fruits have been replaced by new items (including a can of Coca-Cola) and the ghosts' eyes are now a pixel closer to each other. In addition to these cosmetic changes, Plus also changes the gameplay slightly: eating a bonus item will cause the ghosts to turn both vulnerable and invisible, and doubles their point value while they are vulnerable. Eating a Power Pellet also sometimes has unpredictable results, such as turning the maze invisible or turning only three of the four ghosts blue (the latter of which makes it impossible to clear a round by using a pattern). The ghosts are also faster and more aggressive than they were in the original Pac-Man, which makes the game seem overall faster-paced and more difficult by comparison."

The player controls a paperboy on a bicycle delivering newspapers along a suburban street which is displayed in a cabinet perspective (or oblique projection) view. The player attempts to deliver a week of daily newspapers to subscribing customers, attempts to vandalize non-subscribers' homes and must avoid hazards along the street. Subscribers are lost by missing a delivery or damaging a subscriber's house. If the player loses all of their lives, or runs out of subscribers, the game ends.

The game begins with a choice of difficulty levels: Easy Street, Middle Road and Hard Way. The object of the game is to perfectly deliver papers to subscribers for an entire week and avoid crashing (which counts as one of the player's lives) before the week ends. The game lasts for seven in-game days, Monday through Sunday.

Controlling the paperboy with the handlebar controls, the player attempts to deliver newspapers to subscribers. Each day begins by showing an overview of the street indicating subscribers and non-subscribers. Subscribers and non-subscribers' homes are easy to discern in the level itself, with subscribers living in brightly colored houses, and non-subscribers living in dark houses.

The player scores points for each paper delivered successfully, either at a subscriber's doorstep or inside their mailbox, the latter of which awards more points, as well as breakage points by damaging the houses of non-subscribers. A perfect delivery, with all subscribers get their papers, and none of their houses are damaged, results in all the points being worth double for that day, and an extra subscriber is added. At the end of each stage is a training course with various obstacles to throw papers at which gives bonus points and to jump over, and the player scores a bonus for finishing the course. Crashing on the course ends the round, but does not cost the player a life.

When a player fails to deliver a paper to a house, or damages a subscriber's house by breaking their windows, the resident will cancel their subscription, and the house turns dark. The player can regain subscribers by getting a perfect delivery, which adds one extra subscriber.

The paperboy can hold no more than ten papers at once, although refills can be found throughout the level. The papers can be used to stun enemies, with the exception of cars."

Paradise Deluxe is the sequel to Paradise and is a rip-off of ""Gals Panic 2"". Unlike in the first Paradise which featured western nude models, this game has 19 Asian girls across 16 stages.

At the start of the game the player may select any of 12 stages to play. In order to advance past the stage the player must uncover 80% (and in later stages 85%) of the girl's silhouette while avoiding the monsters that occupy the screen.

After each stage there is a bonus game. If the player uncovered less than 90% then the bonus game is a game of roulette which can either reward or punish the player depending on where the player stops the wheel. If over 90% of the silhouette is revealed, then the player can play a game of four card Monte with no worries of punishment. Each mini-game features a different girl that is shown in progressive states of undress with each successive win.

After completing the mini-game, the player again goes to the stage select screen, where each cleared stage removes a tile to reveal one final background image of a seductive nude girl. Completing all 16 stages reveals the entire picture.

The player uses a four-position joystick and a single button to control Pengo, a penguin character. Pressing the button while pushing the joystick against an ice block will cause it to slide in that direction until it hits another block or a wall if the space ahead of it is empty. If that space is occupied, pressing the button will crush the block instead.

The goal is to destroy every Sno-Bee on the board by sliding ice blocks to crush them, crushing blocks that contain unhatched Sno-Bee eggs, or running over them after stunning them at a wall. Doing so in less than 60 seconds awards bonus points based on the time taken.

At the start of each round, a certain number of eggs hatch into Sno-Bees, while other blocks flash to indicate that they contain eggs. As the player destroys active Sno-Bees, new ones hatch from the eggs to replace them. Crushing multiple Sno-Bees with one block awards extra points. The Sno-Bees can crush blocks in an attempt to reach Pengo. Pushing against a wall causes it to vibrate and temporarily stuns any Sno-Bees in contact with it; the player may then crush them with a block or simply run over them to destroy them.

Three blocks in each round are marked with diamonds and cannot be crushed. Bonus points are awarded for forming a continuous vertical or horizontal line of these blocks: 10,000 if none of them are touching a wall, or 5,000 otherwise. Forming such a line also stuns every active Sno-Bee for a short time.

If the player survives for two minutes without either losing a life or completing the round, all active Sno-Bees become Blobs. Their movement speed increases and they will move directly toward one of the walls, crushing all ice blocks in their path. Once a Blob reaches a wall, it will move toward a corner of the screen and disappear upon reaching it. Once all Blobs have either disappeared or been destroyed, the round ends. If the player destroys one of the last two Sno-Bees, the survivor will become a Blob after a 12-second delay. However, if the player destroys multiple Sno-Bees and leaves only one alive, it will become a Blob immediately.

The game includes a total of 16 rounds. After every second round, one of six intermission animations is displayed. It then repeats indefinitely.

One life is lost whenever Pengo touches an un-stunned Sno-Bee or Blob. When all lives are lost, the game ends."

It's actually a strange, overhead shooter much like Robotron. The star is the titular Performan, a native in a jungle that wears a huge mask, who's being stalked by a squadron of drill-wielding robots. He must stop them using balls of energy, his ability to dig underground, and bombs that are set up in every level. He can also go into Power Mode by shooting ghosts that randomly appear, which turns him green and invincible for a short time.

Needless to say, Performan is a very weird, very hard game. There are 99 levels and the game loops endlessly, as typical of most early arcade games. The main problem with Performan is that he's far too weak to survive for long. He can't move quickly, his shots are slow, and he can only have one shot on screen at a time, which can easily be dodged. The bombs are an easy way to get rid of two or maybe three at a time, but this usually requires setup, which takes a bit time, and by which point you're like to be killed."

For every sixteen barrels Momotaro destroys, he will be rewarded with an item that grants invincibility for a limited amount of time, allowing him to defeat enemies by simply touching them. Momotaro's enemies do not have attacks, but a single touch from an enemy will cause him to die and be revived, costing the player one of his/her extra lives; the game will be over when he or she has no more lives. The game has no ending, but following the sixteenth level, the enemy patterns will reset to level one. The layout of the barrels on the stages will continue to change, however, and the enemy count per level will not reset to level one counts. Following level 16, the game may Kill screen at the start of a level or after losing a life."
"Pirates","","Region Not Set","","NIX","Nix","1994-12-01","2","Yes","Shooter","","Pirates was produced by NIX in 1994.

In the early '90s there was this arcade game called ""Blood Bros"".
This little fly-by-night company called Nix apparently decided to clone it, except to differentiate they gave it a pirate theme. So now, a male and female pirate get Engrishy orders from some pirate captain (""Treasure map is in pirate power! You brave and strong!""), and off they go to find pieces of this map that apparently leads to fabulous booty.

Their approach in this is to simply blow the hell out of numerous small towns, stopping only when their thirst for devastation is slaked (you never actually see them pick up a map piece). The view is from behind your pirate warriors, and the joystick moves them left and right while simultaneously maneuvering the reticule you use to aim your shots. You also have a limited supply of bombs you can lob, and a slide that makes you briefly invincible.

Since it clones a good game, the action here is actually reasonably fun, if a bit repetitive. The goal seems to be to blow up every possible structure on each screen, then kill enough pirates until your Bloodthirst Meter is satisfied. The thing that separates it from Wild Guns is the total zaniness of the design. Aside from blowing the crap out of whole town for no good reason, you see a lot of bizarre characters pop up, and everything in the field of play is fair game. In the first level, a barmaid randomly wanders out dispensing beers to everyone, then starts showing off her juggling skills for you ... shoot her down in cold blood and you get a 2000 point bonus. You get a similar bonus for brutally gunning down some society dame that wanders into the battle lost. Sometimes a cow will just wander across the screen at random - fill him full of lead for bonus weapons and bombs. Weapon upgrades include double automatic pistols and what appears to be a machine gun. And at the end of every three-level set you face bosses that include an airship, and even a Giant Enemy Crab."

Similar to Kissy, Takky, and Hommy from Baraduke and Bakutotsu Kijuutei, he will float down to the ground if you stop holding the joystick up while he is in mid-air - and pressing that Firing Button will make his pistol fire a small cannonball. However, holding down the button will charge the pistol (much like Alice's bubble blower in Märchen Maze and Apollo's sword in Phelios), and upon releasing the button the pistol will fire a medium or large cannonball; but even the smallest enemies take multiple hits to kill, so the small cannonballs are of little use.

There is also blue (and yellow) vases which can be broken open with a medium (or large) cannonball, and will leave Hanafuda cards behind, for Pistol Daimyo to collect - and once he has collected three of them, it will cause a Kusudama ball to come down into view from the top of the screen (which can also be broken open with a medium or large cannonball). If he manages to do that before it goes back up off the top of the screen again, it will leave a suit of wooden (or metal if you already have the wooden one) armour behind; once he has put it on, it will prevent him from being killed in a single hit."

In this game, the player controls a Formula One race car and has to complete a time trial lap within a certain amount of time (between 57 and 120 seconds) to qualify for an F1 race at the Fuji Racetrack. After qualifying, the player races against seven other CPU-controlled cars in a championship race (but if they do not qualify, the car will stay on the track until the timer runs out). The player must also avoid going off the road so that they will not crash into the billboards. Play continues until either time runs out in any lap and/or complete four laps of the race, which ends the game.

Pole Position was the first racing video game to feature a track based on a real racing circuit. It was also the first game to feature a qualifying lap, requiring the player to complete a time trial before they can compete in Grand Prix races. Once the player has qualified, they must complete the race in the time allowed, avoiding collisions with CPU-controlled opponents and billboards along the sides of the track. The game's North American distributor, Atari, publicized the game for its ""unbelievable driving realism"" in providing a Formula 1 experience behind a racing wheel.

It is also cited by some as a possible point of origin for the Polybius myth. Poly Play ran on a U880, a clone of the Zilog Z80 CPU, which was clocked at 2.457600 MHz and a custom sound chip. Its display ran at a resolution of 512*256 at 50 Hz and supported a palette of ten colours, though it could also use coloured overlays. The machine's coin slot was designed for 50 Pfennig, but it was flawed - the pressure sensor could be deceived by pressing a 1-Pfennig coin very sharply into the top of the slot. However, this was largely tolerated because the machine was not a capitalistic commercial venture, but a state-owned product found predominantly in FDGB holiday homes, youth hostels and non-profit clubs. The machine ran with a deactivated coin slot in many youth clubs. However, the free play often caused large crowds to form around it, which incited their reactivation.

A Poly Play machine was on display in the Museum of Computing in Swindon, England in 2004. From 2005, the same machine was part of the touring video game show Game On and was exhibited in multiple museums, such as the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago and the Science Museum in London. Two machines can also be seen at RetroGames e.V. in Germany. It is also prominently on display at the Computerspielemuseum Berlin.

GAMES.
Hirschjagd (Deer Hunt) is similar to Robotron: 2084.
Translation from the game: The fleeing deer must be pursued and hunted, but only 10 shots are available. A shot that hits the deer is not deducted. Around every 15 seconds, a shot must be fired or it will be lost.

Hase und Wolf (Hare and Wolf) is a faster-paced Pac-Man clone and was based on the Russian cartoon series Nu, pogodi!, popular in the GDR.
The Hare must eat everything that it can get. It has to avoid the Wolf, who wants to eat it! Scoring: Pea 1 point, carrot 5 points, pear 7 and/or 10 points

Abfahrtslauf (Downhill) is a simple sport game in which one must ski between the flags. The gates go from 6 metres wide, half the screen size (very easy) down to 0.2 metres (impossible). This game can become very fast.

Schmetterlinge (Butterflies) with Pittiplatsch or Mole, both stars of children's television series in the GDR; however, the game is more suited to adults. The flowers act as obstacles that must be traversed.

Schießbude (Shooting Gallery) is a Carnival clone.
Shoot to score. A balloon gives you one point; a duck, two; and a flower, three. Ammunition can be reloaded by shooting into the left magazine. For each of the three rows there is, in the top right, a multiplier field to hit (coloured yellow, blue and pink).

Wasserrohrbruch (Water Pipe Burst) This is the last Poly Play game. The objective is to prevent a room from flooding.
In the room above, a water pipe bursts. By catching drops with the bucket, you can prevent the water level from rising. The bucket can be emptied out of the cellar windows (play button). If the bucket is full, one does not obtain any points. Scoring: Water level too high: -1 game; Caught drop: +5 points; Bucket emptied into the cellar: -x and Bucket emptied out of the window: +3x (where x = amount of drops caught); with good play: +1 game (max. 3).

Additionally, the names of four other games were found in the source code: Der Gärtner (The Gardener), Im Gewächshaus (In the Greenhouse), Hagelnde Wolken (Hailing Clouds, a Space Invaders clone) and Der Taucher (The Diver, a game where malicious fish attack a diver). All four games have been installed on at least some machines, the same goes for the games Im Irrgarten (In the Maze), Der Lindwurm (The Lindworm), Fly and AFU. Another game titled UFO is actually the original version of Hagelnde Wolken, but was edited due to being deemed too martial by the authorities."
"Pong","","Region Not Set","","Atari, Inc.","","1972-11-29","2","No","Action","E - Everyone","Pong (marketed as PONG) is one of the earliest arcade video games and the very first sports arcade video game. It is a tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. While other arcade video games such as Computer Space came before it, Pong was one of the first video games to reach mainstream popularity. The aim is to defeat an opponent in a simulated table-tennis game by earning a higher score. The game was originally manufactured by Atari Incorporated (Atari), which released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created Pong as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, which later resulted in a lawsuit against Atari. Surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work, Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney decided to manufacture the game.

Pong quickly became a success and is the first commercially successful arcade video game machine, which helped to establish the video game industry along with the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. Soon after its release, several companies began producing games that copied Pong '​s gameplay, and eventually released new types of games. As a result, Atari encouraged its staff to produce more innovative games. The company released several sequels that built upon the original's gameplay by adding new features. During the 1975 Christmas season, Atari released a home version of Pong exclusively through Sears retail stores. It was also a commercial success and led to numerous copies. The game has been remade on numerous home and portable platforms following its release. Pong has been referenced and parodied in multiple television shows and video games, and has been a part of several video game and cultural exhibitions."

The player controls Mama Pig, whose babies have been kidnapped by a pack of wolves and who must rescue them using a bow and arrow and slabs of meat. Controls consist of a two-position up/down joystick, which moves an elevator in which Mama Pig rides; and a button, which fires arrows and throws meat.

Each level consists of two rounds. In the first, wolves descend slowly from a high ledge using balloons, which the player must shoot in order to drop them to the ground. Any wolves who reach the ground safely will climb up a set of ladders behind the elevator and try to eat Mama Pig if she moves in front of them. During the second round, the wolves start on the ground and inflate balloons in order to ascend to a cliff on which a boulder is resting so they can push it toward the edge. Airborne wolves throw rocks in both rounds, trying to hit Mama Pig. In addition, the balloon carrying the last ""boss"" wolf of the second round must be shot several times in order to defeat him; if he reaches the cliff, the player must defeat additional enemies before facing the boss again.

A slab of meat occasionally appears at the top of the elevator's range of motion. Picking it up allows the player to throw it, distracting any wolves on/near its trajectory and causing them to let go of their balloons and crash to the ground for bonus points. Stray balloons and dropped fruits can also be shot for extra points.

After every second round, a bonus screen is played. The first such screen requires the player to defeat a group of wolves using only meat, while the second awards points for shooting fruits thrown by the wolves. These two screens alternate after each level.

The player loses one life if Mama Pig is hit by a rock, eaten by a wolf on the ladders (first round only), or crushed by the boulder if too many wolves reach the cliff and push it over the edge (second round only). When all lives are lost, the game ends.

When the game starts, ""The Other Day I Met a Bear"" can be heard during the opening scene (in which the wolves kidnap Mama's babies). The first stage theme bears a very slight resemblance to the main theme music from Frogger, another Konami arcade game. The song is a part of the Desecration Rag (An Operatic Nightmare) by Felix Arndt, the portion that mimics the beginning of Antonín Dvořák's Humoresque Opus 101 Number 7.

It is based on the comic series, Popeye, which was produced by King Features Syndicate.

The object of the game is for Popeye to collect a certain number of items dropped by Olive Oyl, depending on the level — 24 hearts, 16 musical notes, or 24 letters in the word HELP — while avoiding the Sea Hag, Brutus and other dangers. The player can make Popeye walk back and forth and up and down stairs and ladders with a 4-way joystick. There is a punch button, but unlike similar games of the period, no jump button. Conversely, Brutus can jump down a level and also jump up to hit Popeye if he is directly above.

Despite the feature of a punch button, Popeye cannot attack Brutus directly. Instead, the button is used for the following:

Punching destroys items that could hurt Popeye such as bottles, vultures and skulls.
Each level has a can of spinach; punching these cans will give Popeye invincibility and he can knock out Brutus just by running into him, although after a few seconds Brutus will swim back out and be ready for action again.
In Round 1 (the dock scene) of each three-round cycle is a punching bag, which Popeye can use to knock loose a nearby barrel from its position near the top of the playing field. If the barrel falls onto Brutus' head, the player earns bonus points (based on where Brutus was attacked) and renders Brutus harmless for several seconds.
Other licensed Popeye characters in the game are Olive Oyl, Swee'Pea, and Wimpy, though they are mostly decorative and do not add heavily to the gameplay. Wimpy appears in Round 2 (the street scene) on one end of the seesaw in the lower left corner of the field, to act as a counterweight. Swee'Pea floats high above, with bonus points to be earned if Popeye can spring off the see-saw and touch him.
Popeye loses a life if he is hit by Brutus or any thrown/flying object, or if he fails to catch a dropped item before it reaches the bottom of the screen."

Catch the luggage that falls from the top conveyer belt and throw it up into one of four berths on the ship. You need to get four in each berth without getting hit by a rock thrown by the man on the ship, getting run over by the luggage cars or before running out of luggage on the conveyer belt. The second level, you throw a rock up at some crates of dynamite, knocking one down. You need to catch it before it hits bottom. When a crate reaches bottom it explodes, removing the lowest level of your playing area.

Professor Pac-Man is the seventh game in the Pac-Man series and the fourth game in the Pac-Man series to be developed without Namco's involvement.

The game is for one player or two (in a two-player game, the player who is the first to answer a question correctly receives its points) and consists of answering multiple-choice questions before the time runs out. The timer is the original Pac-Man, eating a row of pellets. The more pellets left when the players answer correctly, the higher the scores awarded. As the questions progress, Pac-Man eats the pellets more quickly. Bonus questions are awarded after a player answers between two and six questions correctly on his or her first try. The game ends when a player runs out of fruits (the game's equivalent of lives, which also serve as a difficulty indicator). Fruits are lost for a wrong answer on a regular question (but not a bonus question), and fruits can also be earned for answering a bonus question correctly (but not lost if answered wrong).

Midway had also originally planned to release three different versions of this game: Family (appropriate for all ages, but geared towards younger players), Public (appropriate for general audiences, but geared towards arcades and bars), and Prizes (for casinos).

There were also to be new question upgrades every three months to keep people from memorizing the answers, but the game never caught on.

Although most of the questions have nothing to do with Pac-Man, certain questions (asking: ""How many left/right turns to the fruit?"") show the original Pac-Man maze (with a regular wall in the place of the ghost regenerator) and a line of pellets leading to a fruit in the center, and another question (which first requires the player to study a city scene) asks ""Where would you go to play Prof Pac-Man?"", while others require the player to fill in the blank lower-right square of a 16-square grid, with four different fruits (or Pac-Men facing different directions) in each row. On the questions which first require the player to study table settings (""Which was the correct sequence?"" or ""How many plates were (shape)?""), fruits would appear on the plates and Pac-Man would move from right to left as he ate them, if they were answered correctly, and for the questions which first require the player to study the light-up keys on giant telephones of various colors (""Which number was dialed?""), the receiver would come off the telephone and Pac-Man would appear to speak into it (again, if they were answered correctly)."

The PlayStation version was released by Acclaim in North America, and in PAL regions. The game was a 3D fighter which had combined the normal features of an arcade fighting game with psychic powers. There were eight playable characters available to choose from in the game and a final boss/secret character who is playable through the use of a code. Psychic Force was released without much hype and was not commercially successful at the time of its initial release, but the series has since gained a strong cult fanbase. Psychic Force would later get an arcade-exclusive update titled Psychic Force EX, which was released a year later in 1996. EX would make Keith, the final boss/secret character of the original game a playable character without having to initiate a code and that the characters would receive new color schemes for their costumes while the gameplay was improved and balanced. In 1998, a sequel was released under the title Psychic Force 2012 also for the arcade, and was later ported to the Dreamcast console in 1999. It was eventually adapted to the PlayStation under the title Psychic Force 2, which was released in Japan on October 7, 1999 and later to the PAL regions in 2001. In 2006, the original Psychic Force was re-released as part of as an anniversary pack for the PlayStation 2 titled Psychic Force Complete, which had included Psychic Force 2012 and a special exclusive remixed version of 2012 titled Psychic Force 2012 EX.

The original Japanese version of Pac-Man. The player controls Puck-Man through a maze, eating Puck-dots (also called pellets). When all Puck-dots are eaten, Puck-Man is taken to the next stage. Between some stages one of three intermission animations plays. Four enemies (Akabei, Pinkī, Aosuke, and Guzuta) roam the maze, trying to catch Puck-Man. If an enemy touches Puck-Man, a life is lost and the Puck-Man itself withers and dies. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. Puck-Man is awarded a single bonus life at 10,000 points by default. Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as power pellets that provide Puck-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter as the game progresses. In later stages, the enemies go straight to flashing, bypassing blue, which means that they can only be eaten for a short amount of time, although they still reverse direction when a power pellet is eaten; in even later stages, the ghosts do not become edible (i.e., they do not change color and still make Puckman lose a life on contact), but they still reverse direction."

Q*bert is played from an isometric third-person perspective to convey a three-dimensional look. The game is played using a single, diagonally mounted four-way joystick. The player controls Q*bert, who starts each game at the top of a pyramid made of 28 cubes, and moves by hopping diagonally from cube to cube. Landing on a cube causes it to change color, and changing every cube to the target color allows the player to progress to the next stage.

At the beginning, jumping on every cube once is enough to advance. In later stages, each cube must be hit twice to reach the target color. Other times, cubes change color every time Q*bert lands on them, instead of remaining on the target color once they reach it. Both elements are then combined in subsequent stages. Jumping off the pyramid results in the character's death.

The player is impeded by several enemies, introduced gradually to the game:

Coily – Coily first appears as a purple egg that bounces to the bottom of the pyramid and then transforms into a snake that chases Q*bert. He is often considered the main antagonist and Q*bert's arch-nemesis. Q*bert will die if he collides with Coily.

Ugg and Wrongway – Two purple creatures that hop along the sides of the cubes in an Escheresque manner. Starting at either the bottom left or bottom right corner, they keep moving toward the top right or top left side of the pyramid respectively and fall off the pyramid when they reach the end. Both are dangerous. Q*bert will also die if he collides with them.

Slick and Sam – Two green creatures that descend down the pyramid and revert cubes whose color has already been changed. They do not hurt Q*bert, but are usually irritating to the player since they change the color of the cube to the original or former color.

Contact with purple enemies results in a life lost, whereas the green ones are removed from the board upon contact. Colored balls occasionally appear at the second row of cubes and bounce downward; contact with a red ball also results in a life lost, while contact with a green one immobilizes the on-screen enemies for a limited time. Multicolored floating discs on either side of the pyramid serve as an escape from danger, particularly Coily. When Q*bert jumps on a disc, it transports him to the top of the pyramid. If Coily is in close pursuit of the character, he will jump after Q*bert and fall to his death, awarding bonus points. This causes all enemies and balls on the screen to disappear, though they start to return after a few seconds.

Points are awarded for each color change (15 or 25), defeating Coily with a flying disc (500), remaining discs at the end of a stage (at higher stages, 50 or 100) and catching green balls (100) or Slick and Sam (300 each). Bonus points are also awarded for completing a screen, starting at 1,000 points on the first screen of Level 1 and increasing by 250 on each subsequent completion, up to 5,000 after Level 4.

Holding down one of the draw buttons allows the marker to draw a line (Stix) in unclaimed territory in an attempt to create a closed shape. Once an area is captured, it is filled with color and points are awarded based on the area claimed and drawing speed. Areas captured entirely with Slow Draw (orange-red in the screenshot) are worth double. The titular Qix is a colorful geometric figure in constant and random motion. The Qix will not actively seek out the marker, and it will not harm the marker if it collides with it while the marker is traversing the edge of the playfield or of any captured area. However, if the Qix collides with the marker as it is drawing a Stix before a new area is captured (or it touches the exposed Stix), one life is lost.

The marker cannot cross or backtrack along the line being drawn. If the marker stops while drawing, a fuse appears and burns along the line toward the marker; if it reaches the marker, the player loses one life. The fuse disappears once the marker is moved. If the player draws into a position where it cannot proceed any further, the fuse is triggered. The attract mode calls this a ""Spiral Death Trap"".

Sparx are enemies that traverse all playfield edges except unfinished Stix. A life is lost if one hits the marker. A meter at the top of the screen counts down to the release of additional Sparx and the mutation of all Sparx into Super Sparx, which can chase the marker along uncompleted Stix.

To complete a level, the player must claim a 75% percentage of the playfield (adjustable to be between 50% and 90%). If a level is completed by exceeding the minimum area percentage, a bonus is awarded for every 1% beyond the threshold.

Starting in level three, the player faces two Qixes. Splitting the playfield into two regions, each containing one Qix, ends the level. No immediate bonus is awarded for this, but a bonus multiplier is applied to the scoring in all subsequent levels. This multiplier starts at one before the first time that the Qix are split and increases by one for every additional splitting of the Qix, to a maximum of nine. Levels also add additional Sparx and the eventual appearance of only Super Sparx."

The action takes place over a number of sideways scrolling levels, the bulk of which consist of straightforward platform action. On some levels, however, there are jet packs for the players to collect, and the gameplay's emphasis switched to that of a standard, sideways scrolling shoot-em-up.

The object of the game is to destroy an army of robots that have taken over an Earth colony satellite station. Each level has a boss character that must be destroyed. Upon its death it releases a door key that must be used to exit the level. Weapon and character power-ups can be collected to aid players in their task.

The seventh, fourteenth, twenty-first and twenty-eighth rounds are also ""bonus rounds"", where you have to destroy all the bricks in the formation within a preset time limit (unless all your balls go out of play); the thirty-third and final round is also a ""boss round"", where you are up against ""Burida"" (who is protected by a metal wall with a vulnerable spot on its top side, but does not attack by spitting lethal mirrors like Doh did to both Vaus in Arkanoid and the human Bubblun & Bobblun in Rainbow Islands).

The player controls a space fighter named the R-9 to defend humanity against a mysterious powerful alien life-form known as the ""Bydo"".

The game is composed of several sequential levels, with a boss enemy at the end of each. The player must navigate terrain and fight enemies using various weapons. The player's spacecraft has, by default, a weak but rapid-firing main gun; and a more powerful gun called a wave cannon, which requires the player to hold the fire button to build up power for the cannon.

During the game, the player can obtain an auxiliary device called a Force. This resembles a glowing orange ball. The Force can be attached to the front or back of the player's spacecraft, or detached to fly freely. When attached, the Force provides one of three different powerful weapons, in addition to the main gun and the wave cannon. When detached, these weapons cannot be used, but the Force will instead resort to a secondary set of guns, which can be fired by the player even if the Force is at a distance from the spacecraft. The Force has a secondary use as a shield; it is completely indestructible and can block most things fired at it, as well as damage or destroy enemies on contact."

Two new types of weapons (the Search Laser and Shotgun Laser) were added, bringing the total number of weapon types up to five. A new anti-ground unit bomb was also added to the missile inventory.

Though the number of levels was decreased from the prequel, the number of enemies, their durability, and the number of bullets they shoot were greatly increased. Enemy movements and terrain were also made trickier, bringing the game's difficulty up considerably.

All weapons are available from the start. Weapons can 'level up', however, becoming more powerful as the player uses them to score points. There are a selection of 7 weapons that can be used at any given time:

The game is designed so that there is almost always a 'right' weapon for any situation. The bosses in the game are designed so that they have multiple 'sections' which, if all destroyed before the 'core' of the boss, will award the players with point bonuses. Being able to apply the right weapons on any different boss is key to obtaining these bonuses. For example, a boss may have two sections located on either side of the screen. You could immediately go up to one and begin shooting it with a vulcan, or you could hover in the centre and hit both at the same time with the side bombs. This would increase your chance of obtaining the bonus before the time limit runs out and the boss self-destructs.

The game rewards players for ""chaining"" enemies of just one of three colors, red, blue, or yellow. Whenever the player kills three enemies that are of the same color, who can obtain a points bonus. This also facilitates faster upgrading of weapons."

The game was developed by Japanese company Noise Factory, co-developed by BrezzaSoft and chiefly-designed by the Mexican team Evoga.

Rage of the Dragons features a tag team system, in which the player takes control of two characters and can switch between one or the other during gameplay. The character who is not being controlled will slowly recover part of his or her energy while the other is fighting. The player can perform special combos in which both characters attack an opponent at the same time for added damage.

Evoga originally envisioned Rage of the Dragons as a sequel to the Neo Geo fighting game version of Double Dragon released in 1995. However, Evoga were unable to use the intellectual rights for the characters (which were purchased by the company founded by former Technos Japan staff Million, the developers of Double Dragon Advance), and thus Rage of the Dragons was turned into a homage to the Double Dragon series instead of an official sequel. The two lead characters in Rage of the Dragons, Billy and Jimmy Lewis, share their names with the protagonists of the Double Dragon series, Billy and Jimmy Lee, while Kang is based on Burnov from Double Dragon II: The Revenge, and the boss character Abubo is based on Abobo from the original Double Dragon. Two supporting characters in Rage, Linda (Abubo's female assistant) and Mariah (Jimmy's girlfriend), are also based on Double Dragon characters.

The player controls a blue Formula One race car. The objective is to collect yellow flags that are scattered around an enclosed maze while avoiding collision with red-colored cars that pursue the player. Mazes scroll in the four cardinal directions and are clustered with dead ends, long corridors, and stationary boulders that are harmful to the player. Each level contains ten flags that increase their point value when collected in succession. One of the flags is a ""Special Flag"", indicated by an S next to it, which doubles the value of each flag collected thereafter. The player can temporarily stun the red cars with smoke screens, which depletes a portion of their fuel meter at the right of the screen. The meter constantly depletes the longer the player takes in a level, and acts as a timer. As the game progresses, more red cars are added and become more aggressive.

The player has a radar beneath their fuel meter, which displays their current position on the map as well as the location of the flags and red cars. The third level and every fourth thereafter is a bonus round (called a ""Challenging Stage""), where the objective is to collect the flags in a certain amount of time. In these bonus rounds, the red cars remain idle and will not chase the player unless their fuel is empty."

Like in the first Rampage game, the goal of every stage is to destroy all the buildings in each city while avoiding or destroying the military forces. If the player takes too long in destroying the city, jets will fly in and bomb the remaining buildings, ending the stage with a lower score.

The player has some control over the course of the game. In the first level, Peoria, a tourism billboard cycles through different regions in the country (Northeast, Southwest, etc.). Destroying the billboard when it is showing one of these regions will send the player in that direction. Players may also choose to eat or ignore the ""World Tour"" powerups and control which country they can visit. After getting a World Tour power-up, the next few levels will take place in a foreign location until a Scumlabs plant is destroyed. However, the most memorable power-up is the purple radioactive waste, which transforms the player into a super monster known as V.E.R.N.

"Reactor","","Region Not Set","","Gottlieb","Gottlieb","1982-10-01","2","No","Shooter","","The player controls a cursor that can move freely within a screen-sized arena, the nuclear reactor. The center contains a sun-type gravitational power source, the slowly overheating reactor core. The surrounding wall or the sun, if touched results in death. The cursor is controlled with a trackball by the player, who has to roll it fast in one direction in order to overcome the momentum of gravitation imposed by the sun. Swarms of enemy objects named after various radioactive particles float around in the reactor arena, obeying simple physical laws. These enemies can freely bounce into the walls at low speeds, have a repulsive force against each other and actively attack the player cursor. Boss types often break up into several smaller particles.

The object is to survive the sun and walls while gaining the highest score possible. It takes a delicate touch. Rather than moving the cursor/avatar left, right, up and down as in many arcade games, it is controlled by gravity and moves freely; with the player only being able to accelerate it rather than control its movements directly. Meanwhile the enemy particles are getting so aggressive that it can get very difficult to avoid being pulled in by the sun or touching a wall.

The basic gameplay consists of accelerating the cursor just at the right times so that it circles the reactor core with enough speed to have control via its own momentum when the enemy particles try to knock it off course, and then to place decoys and actually use the acceleration of the ball itself to knock enemies into control rods, traps or the reactor core. By pressing the primary button the player cursor can go into high power mode, providing higher repulsion of enemies and conversely higher risk to the player."

Summary[edit]

Arcade game ending
There are two modes to this game: players can either be the starting pitcher; which is a full 9-inning game for either one or two players or they can be the relief pitcher and do a 12-game season for one player only.An additional relief pitcher mode allows a best of 7 World Series type of play for two players.[2]

There are four fictitious teams (Boston Bashers, Houston Dusters, Los Angeles Speeders, and Chicago Strokers) to choose from with its own special strength.[2][3] Players must choose their favorite special pitch and dive into the more complicated mechanics of pitching a baseball. All the ballplayers in the game are fictional. There are many meters to use while determining whether to strike out the batter or give him an intentional walk instead. Batters also have to deal with meters that have to do with offense rather than defense.[2]

After playing each game, the player is entitled to a certain level of salary. This depends on how good the player performs out in the field. After winning the playoffs in arcade mode, it shows the final box score with a special game over message inside of it.[4] The commentary in this game is done by legendary baseball announcer Jack Buck.[2]"

Controls consist of a mounted machine gun with unlimited ammunition, which fires as long as the trigger is held down, and a button on the side that fires one CD per press.

Revolution X is a rail shooter in which the players must shoot targets including NON soldiers and vehicles, with the ultimate goals of destroying the NON and rescuing the members of Aerosmith. Players start the game at Club X in Los Angeles, first fighting the NON troops inside and then stealing a helicopter to fly across the city and find Aerosmith's car. They must then destroy three NON facilities in the Amazon jungle, the Middle East and the Pacific Rim. These three stages may be played in any order; however, failing to complete the Middle East stage within a set time limit will send the players back to its start for another attempt. Finally, the players advance to Wembley Stadium for the final battle with the surviving NON forces and Head Mistress Helga. Throughout the game, crates and background objects can be shot to reveal power-ups like health-replenishing shakes, CDs, powerful laserdiscs and Super Guns, shields, and Skull Bombs that destroy every enemy on the screen. Players can also find hostages and free them throughout the game for extra points.

At the end of each stage, the players receive bonus points based on the number of enemies killed and hostages rescued, as well as the amount of damage done. The five members of Aerosmith are hidden in secret locations throughout the game. When found, each member presents the player with a set of Aerosmith wings that increase the end-of-stage bonus. All members must be found in order to unlock the best ending and bonus level, in which the players go backstage after blowing up Helga, and can collect high-value Mammy Awards, as well as party with the band."

The core gameplay of the series is to help Gussun and his brother Oyoyo (Vic and Vinnie respectively in Risky Challenge) escape a flooding stage by building a stairway with Tetris blocks. The goal is to reach the ceiling before the water level drowns the pair. Gussun and Oyoyo move independently based on their AI, similar to the titular rodents of Lemmings, and the player needs to anticipate their AI pathing and their habit of occasionally freaking out whenever scary things happen.

The various characters in the game set out to find who is responsible for the attacks on their school, with the cut-scenes and fights portraying their interactions with the other schools and among themselves. Eventually, the story reveals that an elite school in the city, Justice High, is responsible for the attacks. The player's team eventually faces off against Raizo Imawano, the principal of the school, and first boss of the game. If certain requirements are met during the fight against Raizo, the story would continue as the player would then head into a true final boss fight against Hyo Imawano, Raizo's nephew and the true mastermind behind the events of the game.

The structure of the single player game of Rival Schools varied depending on how characters were selected. If two characters from the same school were selected (with a few exceptions), single-player would play in a progressing story with fights predetermined beforehand and each fight preceding and ending with short 2D cut-scenes to explain the story. If two characters from different schools were chosen, the single-player mode would instead play similar to other fighting games, with the player's chosen team fighting against random teams of opponents before facing the boss. In the arcade, character selection was initially limited to selecting two characters from the same school and free selection of any character was accessed through time; the PlayStation versions, which included all characters unlocked by default, had no such restrictions."

Hitting the jump and attack button simultaneously lets Rocky and Maxima attack behind them.

Players can often pick up a fallen robot's limb to club other robots to death with. Also, if players approach a weakened enemy and press forward and the A button at the right time, Maxima or Rocky will rip the enemy in half.

Finally, a defeated enemy will occasionally drop a glowing icon of a human fist. Picking this up causes Rocky or Maxima to transform into a futuristic buggy-like vehicle for a limited time.

The game featured one or two robot bowlers playing with the standard bowling rules. To control the outcome, the game had five buttons: left, right, shoot, hook left, and hook right. ""Hooking"" the ball was the key to getting a good score, as you could only hook the ball after it had been thrown. This made it easy to pick up a spare, but the game made up for it by making splits very common.

Robot Bowl was available in two different dedicated cabinets, an upright and a cocktail, both of them used the same internal hardware.

The Robot Bowl upright was of the common 1970s 'short cabinet' design, as the machine had no marquee and was only as tall as the monitor. Some machines also had a decorative 'ball return' on the front at the very bottom of the cabinet. There is an interesting story behind that. At the time the game was created, Exidy had just purchased Fun Games and had a number of cabinets left over from one of Fun's driving games. They used these cabinets to get Robot Bowl into production quickly. The only problem was that the cabinets had a hole in the front where the gas pedal had been. Michael Cooper-Hart suggested that they silk-screen the words 'Ball Return' over the hole.

The Robot Bowl cocktail was a square box with a perfectly round top. The player controls were on either side of the monitor (and you actually had to look at the game sideways to play). This machine had no decoration of any kind."

Wolf Fang: Kuuga 2001 was released in Japanese arcades in 1991. It was released in arcades outside Japan and re-titled Rohga: Armor Force. The arcade versions outside Japan however, have a number of things cut. There is no story intermissions between the stages and there is no stage selection leading to 4 different endings found on the Japanese version, but the game cycles through all 12 stages like in the Japanese version's expert mode."

Two years have passed since the military occupation of New York City in 1999 and since then Ragnarok (aka: DAGGER) - the organization responsible for the events - have disappeared following their air borne destruction. During that time, mech technology has been the boom of future military projects worldwide with the biggest factories residing in Oceania. These mechs become the main target of Ragnarok when it resurfaces and claims the military factories and cities of Australia and New Zealand. Their plan is to apparently use any and all of the deadliest mechs that have not yet reached completion to their chaotic liking.

The USAF and RAAF organize a strike force to reclaim major attacked points in the two countries with the assistance of the best mech operators they can find. Players then assume the role of mech-fighters who aim to liberate Australia or, depending on the player's actions, New Zealand."

Score values are cut in half from the real show (and rounded up if needed), and feature only four 99-second cycles instead of 45-second cycles within four 6-minute periods.

The players control the two jetters. After referee Don Lastra blows his whistle to begin the cycle, the first lap leads the jetters to the Wall of Death (the heavily banked curve of the jetwave). They get one point for getting three steps in the between the two red lines and three points for getting above the top line. On the jet jump, they get three points for landing beyond the 12-foot marker and one point for landing in front of the line. The rest of the cycle awards one point passing or fighting off opposing blockers (who come back to haunt the jetters afterwards) and three points for lapping or fighting off the opposing jetter. The team with the most points wins.

While it doesn't affect the score of the game (only awarding a small amount of ""power"" to the winner), there is a bonus Street Fighter II style fight that may happen to illustrate the violence and rivalry that happens on RollerGames."

The player takes control of ""Albatross"", a member of the WCPO's (World Crime Police Organization) ""Rolling Thunder"" espionage unit. Albatross's mission is to save a missing agent named Leila Blitz from a secret society named Geldra located in New York City. Albatross must travel through two different segments or ""stories"", both comprised of five stages, for a total of ten game stages. On each stage, Albatross can enter doors, to hide and take cover from enemies, as well jump over to higher or lower floors with rails, including stairs. Albatross begins this game armed with a standard-issue pistol, which can be substituted with a fully automatic assault rifle that allows for continuous firing by holding down the firing button. Albatross can gain ammunition for either weapon, by entering doors which are marked ""bullets"" or ""arms"". Despite the presence of a life meter, Albatross can only take two physical hits from the enemy: a single hit drains half of the meter, and he will be killed instantly when struck by a projectile attack such as enemy bullets or lasers.

The game is the sequel to 1986's Rolling Thunder, retaining the same gameplay of its predecessor but adding cooperative gameplay for two players and improved graphics. Unlike the original, which was based in 1968, Rolling Thunder 2 features a more contemporary setting to go along with its more futuristic design, as well as an optionally playable female character.

Set in the 1990s, the Geldra organization, thought to had been destroyed during the first game, returns and is destroying several of the world's satellites in outer space. As in the original Rolling Thunder, the players must take control of a member of the WCPO's Rolling Thunder task force.

Two players can now play simultaneously, with Player 1 as female agent Leila and Player 2 as male agent Albatross. Even though they possess different external appearances, including different handguns, the two characters have identical abilities. As with the original game, both Leila and Albatross can only take two physical hits from the enemies - and a hit from a bullet or other projectile such as a laser will result in an immediate death for them.

The graphics are noticeably improved over the previous game and have a decidedly more futuristic look to go along with the game's modern setting; the game's main enemy characters, the Maskers, who were previously designed to look like hooded terrorists are now cyborgs. Likewise, the game has more varied stage designs, with the first four stages taking place in a seaside resort in Florida, and the last four stages in a pyramid in Egypt - both locations are actually camouflaged Geldra bases."

Each round also has a preset time limit to ensure that the player does not dawdle - and once it runs out, a green-haired female vampire known as Tsukaima  (who cannot be crushed by the walls) shall appear in search of Chap's blood, as the Yamaha YM2151-generated song (and all the enemies) speed up.

The game's enemies include white blobs known as Pyokorin, pink Triceratops-esque creatures known as Kerara which can breathe flames, armadillos known as Gororin which can roll over Chap, purple seals known as Todorin  which can breathe ice, sponges known as Bekabeka, which can push walls onto Chap, turquoise blobs known as Fumajime Pyokorin, which occasionally pause to take a long drag on their cigarettes, helmet-wearing creatures known as Nachibo, which take two crushes to kill, wolves known as Taggus which can throw bombs at Chap, spiders known as Oogumo, which can spin webs for Chap to run into - and this game's main antagonist, an evil scientist named Gurerin  who only appears on the final round, where players not only have to collect all the keys, but also push the walls onto his four clones (two of whom can breathe fire, but the other two can breathe ice).

A cutscene called ""The Rompers Show"" also appears after every tenth round, and once Chap has rescued Rumina at the end of the game, they both go back to free Tsukaima (who, ironically, is trapped under a wall, given that she cannot be crushed by them in the game), and wrap her feet up with bandages; Chap then starts to carry Tsukaima off on his back, which angers Rumina as he went through a lot to save her."

For example, the player cannot increase his ship speed until a speed icon is picked up; additional speed icons further increase the ship velocity.

Several weapons, when additionally upgraded, turn into a 'super' weapon for approximately ten seconds. If the player has the ripple laser, and then gets another icon for it, the player will receive the high-powered Buster ripple for a short period of time. Options have been slightly changed with the arrival of 'option seeds', which are small options that orbit the ship firing only the basic initial shot. Two option seeds can combine into one full option. Moreover, options can also be sacrificed to utilize a short-term homing beam weapon.

Several enemy bosses typical to Gradius games return, including the Brain Golem (the first level boss) and the Tetran (the second level boss). There are a total of six levels. Since the game is similar to its prequel, Salamander 2 does not use the Revival Start feature from Gradius (which pushes the player back to a pre-determined checkpoint if a life is lost), many people consider this title to be easier than other titles in the Gradius series due to this. Once the game has been completed, it starts its second-loop at a much higher difficulty. The music is also changed to remixed versions of Salamander's music in some stages. The first player's ship is called Vic Viper while the second player's ship is Super Cobra."

Among other series changes, aerial blocking was removed entirely, and the switch-around move, which enabled a player to shift quickly behind the other's back, as well as the dodge (evade, side-step), in which the move virtually brings a semi-3D environment to the defense in attempt to use each sword more effectively.

One can no longer charge one's own ""pow"" gauge. The off-screen delivery man was omitted entirely from the game. The ""CD combo"" was added, wherein a player can press the C and D buttons together, triggering a strike that can be followed up by a sequence of button taps.

SNK also added a ""suicide"" move, wherein one's character forfeits the round. The bonus to this is that the one committing suicide will start the next round with a full ""POW"" gauge. Certain finishes also enable a ""fatality"" move in the vein of Mortal Kombat."
"Samurai Spirits Zero Special","Samurai Spirits V Special MVS | Samurai Shodown V Special MVS","NTSC-J","Japan","SNK Playmore","Yuki Enterprise","2004-04-22","2","No","Fighting","AO - Adult Only 18+","Samurai Shodown V Special[a] is the ninth entry in SNK's Samurai Shodown series of fighting games. It is an upgraded version of the game Samurai Shodown V and is the last official game for the Neo Geo platform.

An ordained meeting of 28 fierce warriors begins, to precede a series of duels to the death. These individuals entrust their fates to their skill and their weapons. For those not up to the task, a cherished end in battle is their only hope.
The twenty-eight Samurai characters clash in one epic title.

The essential mechanics remained largely unchanged from previous games, with the update being directed towards graphical and audio changes. The updated visuals include portraits by artist Satoshi Ito, which convey a dark atmosphere similar to that of Samurai Shodown III.
A significant number of changes exist between Samurai Shodown V and Samurai Shodown V Special. Among them, the characters Sankuro and Yumeji were replaced with Samurai Shodown boss, Amakusa Shiro Tokisada, and Samurai Shodown III boss, Zankuro Minazuki. Also, the hidden character Poppy was replaced with Samurai Shodown II boss, Mizuki Rashojin, and was playable without the need of a hidden code. In addition to the roster change, many graphics and sound changes were made to give the game a fresh feel, even though most of the returning characters used their old voices, dating from Samurai Shodown IV. Existing Samurai Shodown V character stages were modified, and new stages were made for the arrival of Amakusa, Zankuro, and Mizuki.
This game also received many gameplay tweaks, making this version much more balanced than its predecessor. However, the biggest gameplay change was the introduction of the Zetsumei Ougi, or the Overkill Move. When performed correctly, it instantly ends the match for its victim, regardless of how much life he/she has remaining. This concept is similar to that of the Guilty Gear series, except that the conditions for the move are much stricter. The character must be in a rage, and the opponent's life must be below the point where they could have entered Concentration One, introduced in Samurai Shodown V as a special slow-motion mode powered up by meditating (holding D while standing still). The start-up motion is the same for each character, but if it hits the attacking character, it can finish off their victim in their own unique fashion.
In addition to the overkill moves, generic fatality effects from Samurai Shodown IV were brought back for this game, such as being slashed in half horizontally. New fatality effects were also added, such as being split in half vertically with the victim drenching their opponent in blood. In addition, Nakoruru and Rimururu, who were both made ""immune"" to fatal effects in Samurai Shodown III and Samurai Shodown IV, are able to experience these fatal effects at the end of the match, and in some situations, they scream violently.
This combination of violent acts in Samurai Shodown V Special generated much controversy and resulted in SNKP censoring the Neo Geo AES cartridge shortly after the Sasebo slashing."

This feature is a product of the science fiction setting and as such is not seen in other entries in the Rush series. As with previous titles in the franchise, Rush 2049 features a stunt mode in which the player scores points for complex mid-air maneuvers and successful landings. The game also includes a multiplayer deathmatch battle mode and race mode for up to four players. There are six race tracks, four stunt arenas, eight battle arenas, and one unlockable obstacle course named the Gauntlet. Various car types and upgrades are unlockable throughout the game, though cheat codes offer instant achievement of these elements.

Like the House of the Dead games, Sega Golden Gun is a rail shooter in which players blast enemies while the camera travels a predefined path. Pistols are the primary weapons; they hold 12 bullets, and pointing the gun outside the screen will reload them. However, if the player continues shooting with no bullets remaining, the gun will automatically reload. Consequently, this reloading takes longer. Blue and red reticles appear wherever players 1 and 2 aim, respectively. Most levels end with a boss fight.

In each stage, an item merchant will appear twice in the background; shooting him activates the Item Shop. Here, players can spent the points they've accumulated on special items, including different weapons, enemy weakeners, and bonus lives. Item prices increase during multiplayer and for each stage the player advances. If the player runs out of lives and continues, they will get items as a bonus.

Similar to House of the Dead: Scarlet Dawn, the game is comprised of a prologue chapter, three middle chapters -- BaiJiaFang (百家坊), JiuQuYuan (九曲园), and ShiLiTan (十里滩) -- that can be selected in any order, and a final chapter once all have been completed. Unlike Scarlet Dawn, the route is set once players decide on the second chapter, and there are no branching paths.

Plot
Two college students (both unnamed) are touring China for a trip. While inside a museum, the two are suddenly attacked by mythical creatures and zombies. However, a security guard from the museum gives the two Golden Guns and explains how to use them. With the guns in hand, the two students use them to fight back against the monsters as well as trying to figure out the source of where they're coming from.

Throughout the game, the students travel to different parts of China each overrun with creatures and a boss at each end. Each boss is a reincarnated form of a mythical figure from Chinese history. They fight Zhang Jiao, a sorcerer from the Han Dynasty who takes on the form of a giant turtle in the town of BaiJaiFang, Gao Qin, an advisor from the Qin Dynasty who battles with a dragon in the JiuQuYuan palace, and Da Ji, a concubine from the Shang Dynasty in possession of a tiger spirit in the ShiLiTan city. Occasionally, the students battle a hooded figure who requests to test their strength in every location; he is later revealed to be the Monkey King who wants to see if the students can defeat the final boss.

Once the final boss has been defeated, the Monkey King begins the task of repairing the city while students decide to go to the arcade and play House of the Dead.

In the post-credits scene, the museum security guard is revealed to a spirit as well and becomes surprised when he hears the students have defeated the four mythical beasts. He then teleports away to an unknown location to report to his boss about them."

"Sega Rally 2 Championship","","Region Not Set","","Sega","Sega","1999-11-24","2","No","Racing","","Sega Rally 2 is the sequel to Sega's hit arcade game, Sega Rally. This game, like it's predecessor, is based on Rally racing. Rally racing is unique in that races take place on both race tracks and off-road courses. The courses in this game reflect this nicely. Some take place in the desert or forest, others take place in cities.

The cars in this game are all actual rally cars, with manufacturers from Europe and Japan both well represented. You do not get to see very many of them at one time, however, since rally races are typically time-based events. In this game, you are not competing directly against the other cars, you simply have to have the best time through the course. So, during any race you will usually see a handful of other cars on the track."
"Sega Rally 3","","Region Not Set","","Sega","Sega","2008-06-30","1","No","Racing","E - Everyone","Sega Rally 3 is the arcade sequel to Sega Rally 2, developed and released by Sega. Unlike most other installments in the series, this was not released in Japan.

Gameplay
Sega Rally 3 contains three racing modes: World Championship, Quick Race and Classic. World Championship mode is a single player game which takes place across three stages (Tropical, Canyon and Alpine) and largely follows the format of the previous Sega Rally arcade games. The game is a 22 car race played to a time limit, and the player's starting position for one race is determined by their finishing position in the previous race. Unlike the previous games in the series, each race contains two laps. If the player finishes the third stage in first place, they are able to play a head to head race on the bonus Lakeside track.

Quick Race is a single or multiplayer mode, in which six cars (containing any mixture of human and AI players) race three laps on any of the three World Championship courses. In World Championship and Quick Race modes, players can choose from one of six licensed cars from Citroën C4 WRC, Ford Focus RS WRC 07, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X, Peugeot 207 S2000, Subaru Impreza WRC 08 and Suzuki SX4 WRC. Additionally, in Quick Race players can choose two secret cars: the Bowler Nemesis and the McRae Enduro.

Classic mode is a single or multiplayer mode which takes place on the Desert '95 track, recreated from the original Sega Rally arcade game. In single player, the mode is a head to head race against a single AI opponent, while multiplayer allows for up to six human players with no AI opponents. The sixth generation Toyota Celica GT-Four and Lancia Delta HF Integrale cars from the original Sega Rally can be used in this mode exclusively.

Development
The game was developed simultaneously with Sega Rally Revo. During development, it went under the codename of 'Super Challenge'. The game runs at 60 frame/s at a 720p resolution as opposed to the 30 frames per second of its console counterpart due to the power of the new Sega Europa-R arcade hardware.

Sega Rally 3 was released in 2011 on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network as Sega Rally Online Arcade, it is essentially the same title, except with a few extras including the original Sega Rally 1995 Desert track.[citation needed] The game has been delisted for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network in 2012 for unexplained reasons."

As the first racing game to incorporate this feature, Sega Rally is considered to be one of the milestones in the evolution of the racing game genre.

The music for the arcade game was composed by Takenobu Mitsuyoshi, while the Sega Saturn port's soundtrack was done by Naofumi Hataya and the Guitar were played by Joe Satriani."

The game supported three players playing simultaneously, and possessed a unique track ball set up for moving on-screen characters.[1] The only other control input was a single button, allowing the player to perform a jumping attack. The use of the trackball has subsequently led to great difficulty in emulation efforts, with Sonic creator Yuji Naka stating it as the reason for it not being included on future compilations or rereleases, such as Sonic Gems Collection.[2]

Gameplay in SegaSonic the Hedgehog has been likened to the game Marble Madness.[3] Up to three players can play as either Sonic the Hedgehog, Mighty the Armadillo or Ray the Flying Squirrel, as they are kidnapped by Dr. Eggman and placed on an island filled with death traps that they must escape from. The game, played in an isometric perspective, is controlled using a trackball to control a character's direction and speed and a button used to make the character jump into a Spin Attack. Using these controls, players must try to make it to the end of each course whilst avoiding traps and staying ahead of the danger behind them. Each character has a life bar which goes down if the player falls into traps, with the player losing a life if the bar empties. Health can be recovered by collecting rings that are littered around the course or hidden inside obstacles or enemies. A bonus is awarded if the player collects over a certain percentage of rings within a level."

The killings took place within twenty hours.
On July 31st, the 31st victim was found. The police force classified the case as special crime #568, and began to seek investigators from occult sources.
The story begins on July 23rd, after the 32nd victim's death, where Kohtaro Kuga and several others set out to investigate. 

The player, as one of six characters, must get through five worlds, each consisting of two to three levels each. A boss is fought at the end of each stage, who must be defeated to progress further through the story.
Unlike later games, the first title requires the character to power up his/her the starting weapon through four levels. This is easily done at the beginning due to lack of severe dangers. But should the player get killed in later stages, obtaining these power-ups may become more difficult.
The scoring gimmick of the Shikigami no Shiro series is the ""Tension Bonus System"". As the player moves closer to danger, the score multiplier increases, to a maximum of 8x. This multiplier affects both score and the number of coins released by defeated enemies.
Killing an enemy with the player's Shikigami weapon causes all coins released by that enemy to by auto-collected immediately. 

The arcade release of Shikigami No Shiro uses Taito's G-Net system, which stores games on interchangeable ROM cards. The hardware is based on Sony's Playstation.

The dialogue is unique for each different pair of characters selected, resulting in, according to the publisher, 55 different scenarios. Each character has a primary standard attack, which is generally forward-shooting bullets. This is activated by tapping the fire button or by pressing an auto-fire button on home consoles. The secondary attack is known as a Shikigami Attack, activated by holding the fire button, or pressing a dedicated button on consoles. This attack is often more powerful, but slows or stops the character completely. Each character's shikigami is unique and also comes in two variants that are chosen at the start of the game.

The Tension Bonus System returns, whereby the player's weapons are strengthened and the score is multiplied by up to 8 when the player grazes enemy bullets. Also, the player can expend a bomb to allow for an automatic TBS for a short period of time. When Tension Bonus reaches x8, player's normal shots are fired at increased rate and inflict stronger damage. At the end of the stage, coin bonus collected when defeating an enemy with maximum Tension Bonus is added to player's score. Hi-Tension Max is introduced in this game, which causes the multiplier to stay at 8x, and causes enemies to drop 1.5 times the amount of coins when destroyed. High Tension Max is activated by using one of the player's bombs. 

The third game in the series features the most characters of the entire series, but drops out Kim Dae-jeong and Niigi Gorgeous Blue, who both were featured and playable in the predecessor. Sayo Yuuki is also taken out of the playable roster, and now replaces Kohtaro's decased shikigami, Sazae."

The controls of Shinobi consist of an eight-way joystick and three action buttons for attacking, jumping, and using ninjutsu techniques called ninja magic. The player can walk forward, or perform a crouching walk by pressing the joystick diagonally downward. The player can jump to higher or lower floors by pressing the jump button while holding the joystick up or down. The protagonist Joe Musashi's standard weapons are an unlimited supply of shurikens, and punches and kicks. Rescuing certain hostages in each stage will grant him an attack upgrade replacing throwing stars with a gun, and his close-range attack becomes a katana slash. Musashi's ninjutsu techniques can only be used once per stage and will clear the screen of all enemies, or cause significant damage to a boss. Depending on the stage, the three ninjutsu techniques are a thunderstorm, a tornado, and a doppelganger attack.

Enemies include punks, mercenaries, ninjas, and the Mongolian swordsmen guarding each hostage. Musashi can bump into most enemies without harm and can only be killed if he is struck by an attack, gets hit by a projectile, or falls into a bottomless hole. The stage will then restart, but any saved hostages will be retained. When the player runs out of lives, additional coins will continue the game except the final mission. The time limit is three minutes per stage and bonus points are awarded for time, with additional bonuses for refraining from ninjutsu technique (except on the fifth level) or using only melee attacks. Extra lives are awarded for achieving certain scores, completing the bonus round, or rescuing a special hostage.

A bonus round has a first-person perspective of throwing shurikens at incoming enemy ninjas, for an extra life."

In the resulting confusion, the terrorists manage to capture the entire First Family, and are demanding the release of their leader (the dictator) in exchange for the safe return of the president. Washington officials have decided to resolve the problem quietly, using military force.

The player assists police at the scene of the kidnapping, from several high rise structures and after making a choice on tactics, the player defeats one of the terrorist leaders and manages to rescue the president's daughter in the process. Next the player pursues a terrorist boss in order to safely rescue the President's Wife. Finally, the player makes an invasive entry into the terrorist base. After fighting through the heavily guarded mansion, the player defeats Monica and liberates the President himself. However, the dictator is making a getaway and the player exhausts nearly an entire magazine on bulletproof glass and has only one bullet left to eliminate the dictator. 


The game uses a rifle that is mounted on the console, requiring players to physically alter their position in order to shoot accurately. In addition, the rifle's scope displays a close-up view of a small portion of the screen, representing the sniper's long-range view of the area where the rifle is pointed. Certain stage areas are dark and require players to use night vision scopes to spot and shoot opponents. The player can fire five shots in succession before reloading is required.

Players have limited time and health during gameplay. The time can be extended by killing certain enemies and extra health can be gained by finding and scoping an attractive woman in addition to bonus points. The game consists of three stages corresponding with the members of the First Family. In each stage, the player(s) must kill as many enemies as possible in short time facing sub bosses along the way and a large boss at the end. Unless a precise, lethal head shot is made, it will take more than one bullet to kill a sub-boss or boss. Enemies can shoot the player if they are not killed fast enough. Players must take care not to shoot innocent civilians in the crossfire. During game stages the player is able to choose one of two (easy, hard) or three (easy, medium or hard) paths to progress, facing a different boss and doing a different following mission depending on the choice made.

Points are scored based on where an opponent is hit, multiplied by the number of successful shots the player has made. In arcade mode, the best points are given for headshots, but on the practice range, bonus points are obtained for shooting the human shaped targets' guns.

The home versions have a cheat code where one can exchange life for time and vice versa. There are also secret codes for all versions that will make the game more difficult, such as hiding target indicators on enemies."

The player pilots a lone spacecraft, flying through a large region of space, part of which is shown on the mini-map at the top of the screen. Shooting drifting planetoids releases small, white crystals. When collected, each crystal turns into a ""Sinibomb"", which is the weapon for defeating the end of level boss, Sinistar, an animated spacecraft with a demonic skull face. A planetoid contains a limited number of crystals; shooting it too rapidly causes it to explode.

Sinistar does not exist at the start of a level, but is constructed by red enemy worker ships. Workers cannot hurt the player, but they compete to collect crystals to build the Sinistar. Warrior ships directly attack the player's ship, shoot planetoids to mine crystals, and guard the Sinistar while it is being built. It takes 20 crystals to create the 20 pieces of a completely built Sinistar, but only 13 Sinibombs to destroy it. The 7 pieces making up the face are considered a single piece once Sinistar is active.

When the Sinistar is complete, its digitized voice announces ""Beware, I live"" and Sinistar chases the player's ship while making threatening remarks: ""Run! Run! Run!"", ""Beware, coward!"", ""I hunger!"", ""Run, coward!"", and a loud roar. It has no weapons, but it destroys the player's ship on contact, after which it sometimes proclaims ""I am Sinistar"". A dedicated button releases a Sinibomb which automatically targets the Sinistar. A Sinibomb can be intercepted mid-flight by Workers, Warriors, and planetoids. Successfully damaging the Sinistar causes angry roaring.

The player warps to a new zone each time Sinistar is defeated. The unnamed first zone is followed by the Worker Zone, Warrior Zone, Planetoid Zone, and Void Zone, then it cycles back to the Worker Zone.

The player's plane is equipped with machine guns and torpedoes and ammunition is unlimited.

The colour of the sky changes according to the time of the day (afternoon, evening, night). F6F Hellcats (F4U Corsairs in the Arcade Version) are common enemy fighter planes the player will encounter.

Sometimes when player has shot down a number of B-24s, they would encounter a falling satellite across the screen. A high number of points would be rewarded if the satellite gets destroyed. There are bonus stages in this game.

Enemy resistance comes not only from the air, but from land and sea as well. Sometimes, an American naval destroyer or submarine would try to down the player's plane with anti-aircraft fire.

The power can be refilled, and the ship itself upgraded, through collecting the power-ups that appear after destroying certain enemies.

The game can be played by up to two players in alternating turns. Similar as in Gorf, it features several different types of waves (stages). For instance, one stage features space witches saddle-perched on either serpentlike Chinese dragons or Western-style winged dragons: the dragons must to be hit repeatedly in the weak point of their heads to be killed, after which the riders themselves can be shot for a score bonus.

"Sky Skipper","","Region Not Set","","Nintendo","Nintendo","1981-01-01","2","No","Action","","The object is to rescue an assortment of animals that have been caged by mischievous gorillas. You must pilot your biplane through a scrolling maze and rescue those animals by first dropping a bomb on a gorilla that momentarily knocks him out on his duff which in turn opens the cages. During his brief period of incapacitation you must fly your plane low enough without touching any part of the maze and graze the released animals thus effecting their rescue. You must move quickly since the gorilla will eventually leap back on his feet at which time the cages are locked.

There are four cell blocks and two gorillas per maze. Each gorilla can open two sets of cages. You can lose a plane by bumping into the walls of the maze, into a gorilla, or into one of a trio of clouds that float across the maze in the game's higher skill levels. Since running out of fuel will also cost you a life, you have to keep an eye on your fuel guage, located at the bottom of the screen. The only way to replenish your tanks is to pick up one of each kind of animal: one duck, one rabbit one cat and one turtle. Complete the first maze and you go on to the second maze that is slightly more complex. Complete the second maze and you return to the first maze at a higher level of difficulty and so on. The game is over when you lose all four biplanes that you get at the beginning of the game.

Skillful and cautious flying are the key to success in the game. Do not move too quickly even if it means you will miss out before the gorilla rights himself. Instead, just go back and bomb him again. You will fly faster to your destination if you point your plane vertically, but in trying to level off you will invariably crash before rescuing. Your best bet is to glide in a horizontal position when rescuing, thus avoiding the dangerous manuever of righting yourself when you reach the animals."

Moving from one room to the next within the studio/arena, players have to shoot down hordes of enemies who advance from all sides while at the same time collecting weapons, power-up items, and assorted bonus prizes, until a final showdown with the show's host where players are finally granted their prizes, life and freedom. Among the game's items are keys – if enough keys are collected, players can access a bonus level called the Pleasure Dome.

Pressing left causes them to move more slowly than the screen scrolls, essentially continuing to move forward but at a reduced pace. Pressing right does the opposite - SonSon and TonTon will move across the platforms faster than the screen scrolls. The duo have only one attack - the ability to fire energy blasts from their stalves. Touching an enemy or an unfriendly projectile causes the player to lose a life.

The cloud will eventually disappear on its own if the control stick is not used.

Power-ups come in the form of various fruits which produce points (with enough points giving the player an extra life). Gathering certain fruit will cause all enemies currently on a screen to turn into point-bearing fruits.

"Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing Arcade","","Other","","Sega","Sega","2010-01-01","8","Yes","Racing","E - Everyone","SYNOPSIS: Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing Arcade is a port of the same game which was released for Xbox 360, Playstation 3, Wii, Nintendo DS and PC in 2010. The game is Sega’s answer to titles like Mario Kart, featuring power-ups for characters to obtain on the track and a roster that features characters from various Sega franchises. Beyond that simple comparison however, SSASR also includes features such as drifting. Tracks reflect environments seen in Sega games over the years. This game marks the first time Sonic will appear as a star of his own arcade game since Sonic The Fighters was released in 1996.

The game was first seen on location test at a Chuck E. Cheese in Illinois and was officially introduced at EAG 2011 in London during the last week of January. You can read a preview of the game here by Arcade Heroes editor Heavy Electricity. Part of that review states: “The drift pedal allows players to slide through corners and perform tricks in the air, charging a turbo boost. Meanwhile, the full range of items is available to each player, and includes the usual projectiles as well as shields, speed boosts and even a horn which knocks out nearby racers.”  (Note to our readers: please keep in mind that the versions of the game shown so far are still betas and anything could change about the game prior to it’s release)

To maintain player accessibility a couple of tracks from the console version were removed(particularly the Super Monkey Ball levels) but the game includes a ticket redemption option that could be added to the game. The game also uses a separate pedal for drifting and has buttons on the steering wheel (similar to R-Tuned) for power-up usage. It also has three game modes to pick from:

Time trial – Race alone to set the fastest times on each track – there are “Staff Ghosts” to beat

Quick Race – Race and battle against others, single or multiplayer

Grand Prix – Progress through a single player, three race championship

The cabinet design is similar to what Sega has used recently with arcade titles such as Sega Racing Classic and GRID but with a notable upgrade: the sides and seats are translucent and constantly change color, as a part of the attract mode. The screen included with these cabinets has typically been a 32″ HD LCD.The arcade standard wheel/pedal controls should mean that the game will have superior control over the home versions. The game can also link up to eight units locally."

"Sonic the Hedgehog 2","","Region Not Set","","Sega","Sonic Team","1993-10-01","2","No","Platform","","Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was one of the games adapted for release in arcades for both the Mega-Tech and Mega Play hardware.

The Mega Play version has a number of differences from the Mega Drive game but less than the Sonic 1 Mega Play version did. Cheat codes cannot be used as the Options menu is missing. The two player mode selection is present and accessible by inserting two credits to play (one for each player) and pressing the 2P start button. The mode behaves slightly differently, presenting the continue screen after either player wins a zone and prompting the two players to insert credits and try again. In the 1-player mode, neither 50,000 points nor 100 rings awards the player with an extra life. Instead, the player is awarded a single 1-up at 30,000 points in order to make the game more difficult for an arcade experience. In the single-player game, 1-up monitors are replaced with 10 ring monitors, and 1-up monitors will not come up on the random monitors in 2-player mode. All Zones are present, unlike in the Mega Play version of Sonic 1. Special Stages are also missing and when passing a checkpoint no circle of stars will appear. Although no emeralds can be collected you will automatically receive the good ending when completing the game. There is also no high score table. In the 1-player mode, the time counter on the HUD has been removed completely, but it is still present for both participants in the 2-player mode."

The player picks one of three different ships - red, green or blue - each with their own pilot, fire pattern and laser web. Each ship has a standard gun and a bomb, but the most distinctive of these aspects is the laser-web: holding down the button for the standard gun will release a lock-on laser-web traditionally shaped as a cone or semicircle, which will destroy the enemies it locks onto after releasing the buttons. Each ship has two different lock-on weapons that function as web-designed laser targets. Once an enemy enters the web's range, the player can destroy the enemy or multiple enemies can be destroyed via homing lasers or multiple fire-balls. The game is unusual in that, rather than using a 3:4 aspect ratio to better suit the vertically-oriented gameplay, it uses a horizontal monitor (4:3) in the style of Neo Geo vertical shooters as well as the later Radiant Silvergun and Giga Wing."

     The mystical sword of the legends, the ""Soul Edge"", ended up in the hands of the dreaded pirate Cervantes de Leon of Spain. For the next 25 years he stayed dormant on the remnants of a Spanish port town, taking the souls of those who reached him during their search of the sword. His reign of terror was soon to start, but through the joined efforts of Greek divine warrior Sophitia Alexandra and Japanese ninja Taki, he was stopped and killed, with one of the twin Soul Edge blades being shattered in the process. As it was about to tear itself apart, young Prussian knight Siegfried Schtauffen approached the port town and battled Cervantes, whose corpse had been momentarily reanimated through Soul Edge's will. After emerging victorious, Siegfried's attention turned unto the sword. The moment he took the hilt of the cursed blade, Soul Edge released a bright column of light into the sky. This was known as the ""Evil Seed"", bound to bring calamity and death in its wake.

Three years after those events, Soul Edge uses Siegfried as its host, and now Siegfried is Nightmare, a knight wearing azure armor and sporting a hideously deformed right arm. Europe plunges into a vortex of slaughters as he and his followers claim souls to strengthen the blade in its weakened state.

Players can move space ship left or right and shoot a rapid-fire laser at attacking Firebirds. A special Warp Mode allows the space ship to escape danger and fire at the flock of aliens.

FIREBIRDS
The space Firebirds are a unique set of adversaries. There are three different birds, the Emperor, Eagle and Gull, which fly together in complex looping formations, firing and attacking from all directions. The player must keep track of the laser hits because each bird has a different resistance level to hits. The fearless Emperor is destroyed by four hits, the Eagle with two hits and the soaring Gull with one hit. The Eagle also has a deadly bomb which is launched at the space ship. Extra points are scored by hitting the bomb before it explodes. The bomb when hit, scatters into deadly shrapnel. To avoid the flying shrapnel, the bomb must be hit from directly underneath.

SPACE SHIP
The space ship can be moved right or left to evade attacking Firebirds. Depressing the fire button enables the space ship to shoot its laser at approaching Firebirds. Players receive 3 (adjustable) space ships per play.

WARP MODE
Activate warp mode to escape impeding danger or to strike out at approaching birds. There is only warp mode per space ship. When activated, the space ship is launched into space with a force field around it that deflects enemy fire. In warp mode, Firebirds can be eliminated by ramming into them or by firing at close range.

If all Firebirds are destroyed, the player moves into a new battle sequence that increases in difficulty. One new space ship is awarded for a score of 5,000 (adjustable) points. Game ends when all space ships are destroyed."

Space Harrier is played in a third-person perspective behind the protagonist, set in a surreal world composed of brightly colored landscapes adorned with checkerboard-style grounds and stationary objects such as trees or stone pillars. At the start of gameplay, players are greeted with a voice sample speaking ""Welcome to the Fantasy Zone. Get ready!"", in addition to ""You're doing great!"" with the successful completion of a stage. The title player character, simply named Harrier, navigates a continuous series of eighteen distinct stages while utilizing an underarm jet-propelled laser cannon that enables Harrier to simultaneously fly and shoot. The objective is simply to destroy all enemies - who range from prehistoric animals and Chinese dragons to flying robots, airborne geometric objects and alien pods - all while remaining in constant motion in order to dodge projectiles and immovable ground obstacles.

Fifteen of the game's eighteen stages contain a boss at the end that must be killed in order to progress to the next level; the final stage is a rush of seven past bosses encountered up to that point that appear individually and are identified by name at the bottom of the screen. The two other levels are bonus stages that contain no enemies and where Harrier mounts an invincible catlike dragon named Uriah, whom the player maneuvers to smash through landscape obstacles and collect bonus points. After all lives are lost, players have the option of continuing gameplay with the insertion of an extra coin.

Space Launcher is a game by Nintendo that was surprisingly original - the game is similar to Frogger, though is not a clone since it predates it by at least two years.

The game takes place in space, and your goal is to maneuver around space objects and dodge oncoming enemy fire from the aliens that are stationed above. There are treasures at the top: and your goal is to fly up, grab the treasure, and come soaring back down. You must repeat this until all of the treasures have been scavenged.

TRIVIA
Released in November 1979.

SCORING
Knocking out ships: 50-100 points (first two attempts)
Landing in top docks: points above docking station
Safely Landing on the ground: 500 points
Point values increase as you become more successful.

TIPS AND TRICKS

    Use rockets to get up faster. Lay off the rockets only to get around a moving mine or to avoid ramming an enemy ship.
    Spend as little time underneath a ship as you can. Enemy shots move quickly in this game.
    When you start going downward, don't go sideways until after you've hit one of the upper level ships. Your ship isn't immune to the sides of the docking station.
    Again, use the rockets. Again, missiles move fast and it is best to be speeding away from the ships. You also get to the ground faster."
"Space Odyssey","","Region Not Set","","","Sega","1981-01-01","2","No","Shooter","","Space Odyssey is a multi-scrolling shooter arcade game, released by Sega in 1981 and licensed to Gremlin Industries for US manufacture and distribution; it runs on Sega's G80 Raster hardware, and has no connections to the 1967 film 2001: A Space Odyssey. The player must use an 8-way joystick to take control of a spaceship (which will always be moving forward - either horizontally, or vertically, but you can direct it anywhere) with two buttons to make it fire shots at and drop bombs on enemies.

Every round is comprised of seven sectors; the player must kill the attacking enemy ships, for points, while the distance that has been covered by the ship and its current speed are displayed on the right side of the screen. Your distance travelled and ship speed will also determine the bonus you receive at the end of each round - but you should try not to pass over the black holes as they will temporarily immobilize your ship. The meteors you will encounter in the game are also indestructible but you will receive one extra life at a predetermined point value; the point values you receive for killing enemies will also increase with each round, as every enemy is worth 100 points x (the current round number)."

Predating Nintendo's Donkey Kong, and lacking a jump mechanic, Space Panic was the first game involving climbing ladders between walkable platforms. The genre was initially labeled ""climbing games"", but later became known as platform games.

The main character can move along platforms and climb the ladders between them. The goal is to dig holes in the platforms and lure aliens into them. Hitting a trapped alien with the shovel knocks them out of the hole and off the screen. In later levels, two or more holes must be lined up vertically in order to dispose of stronger aliens.

There is a limited supply of oxygen, which acts as a timer."

Special bonus rounds feature after stages two, six, ten and fourteen.

Rammers and Spectars continue to appear from flashing pods, so you cannot rest and plan your course easily, or you will be overwhelmed by the alien force.

Graphic is highly improved compared to his predecessor: the maze now has barricades that must be avoided or can be used as a shielding against the enemies, and has ten environement settings, changing from the ""square-block town"" of Targ to a city, a forest, a lunar landscape and many more. The enemies too are smarter and faster, and the fact that they go on spawning from the pods makes the game a even more frenzy challenge."

It was even said that it was in this house that he created the most hideous creatures that ever walked the face of the Earth, but no-one knew for sure; he had not been seen or heard from in years, and no-one who had ever gone into the mansion had survived to tell the tale. Rick and his girlfriend, Jennifer, were parapsychology majors at their local university - and they were both very interested in the works of Dr. West, as he was the most famous parapsychologist in the world.

One day, they decided to visit the abandoned mansion, as part of a project they were working on in school; as they walked towards that mansion, it started to rain. They entered - all went dark. Lightning cracked through the sky; there was a frantic scuffle. Then a scream - and suddenly Jennifer had gone. Rick's unconscious body was covered with blood; hours later, he awoke to a fantastic horror. He was alone, and also drenched with blood, but the most terrifying thing of all was that a hideous mask was covering his face - he had read tales of this mask (known as the ""Terror Mask""), in Dr. West's writings. It was said to possess ancient spiritual powers; as his only hope, Rick must now depend on this mask, to grant him the strength and courage to find Jennifer.

"Stagger 1","Red Hawk","Region Not Set","","Afega","Afega","1997-01-01","","No","Shooter","","Stagger 1 / Red Hawk is a 1997 vertical scrolling shooter arcade game created by Afega.

Stagger 1 / Red Hawk was Afega's big breakthrough. Even though its success was mostly expressed in the spreading of bootlegs in China, Afega still claimed to have exported more than 10,000 machines. In Korea, the game was originally published before the summer vacation of 1997, but called back for some reason, and not sold again until November the same year. At first sales were slow because of the low machine price of 250,000 Won (which lead arcade owners assume low quality), but after word-of-mouth had spread, the game became a hit in its home country, too6.

While it didn't bring anything new on the shmup table, Red Hawk's biggest strength was its bombastic arsenal, throwing together all kinds of weapon systems that are seen in the genre. Besides the highly upgradeable standard weapon, planes can charge for a devastating, screen filling special attack. Those don't replace smart bombs, though, as those are available, too. Finally, there's a number of sattelites to further boost fire power. All weapons are unique for each of the four different pilots, too.

The game originally used an upright monitor, but for some reason some of the European releases swapped the horizontal and vertical resolution around for ordinary display orientation. This makes the game noticably harder, as enemies are seen later. In Japan, the game was distributed as Stagger I (with the upright screen resolution)."

"Star Fire","Star Fire II","Region Not Set","","Exidy, Inc.","Exidy, Inc.","1980-10-01","1","No","Shooter","Not Rated","Star Fire is an early color game programmed by David Rolfe with graphics designed by Ted Michon and Susan Ogg. It was released by Exidy in 1979. Star Fire is a first-person space shooter where your mission is to seek out and destroy enemy spacecraft while avoiding incoming missiles.

If a number of elements of Star Fire seem similar to Star Wars, your eyes are not deceiving you. Star Fire was originally designed as a Star Wars game, with the eventual hope that either a license would be purchased or that they would change enough of the elements to avoid any legal entanglements. Originally, the authors had hoped that Midway would pick up the game for distribution, but they passed and instead Exidy purchased the game and released it.

Star Fire was the first game to come in an environmental cabinet, designed by Michael Cooper-Hart. Even more importantly from a historical perspective, Star Fire was the first game to keep a high score list where the player could enter his or her initials. Prior games had tracked the concept of a high score, but Star Fire was the first to let you personalize the high score entry and display a top ten list with your initials next to your high score.

An update to Star Fire, simply called ""Star Fire II"", was intended to go into the last run of Star Fire units. It features a more refined high score display and easier high score input."
"Star Fire 2","","Other","","Exidy, Inc.","Exidy","1970-01-01","2","No","Shooter","Not Rated","Star Fire is a first-person space combat game released in arcades by Exidy in December 1978. It was distributed in Japan by Taito and Esco Trading in 1979. Designed by Ted Michon, the look and feel of Star Fire is directly lifted from the movie Star Wars, though the game is not officially licensed.

Star Fire was a minor success, but it is known as the first arcade video game to use a sit-down cockpit cabinet, and the first to allow a player to enter their initials on the high score table. Though not the first game in full color without the use of monitor overlays, it was unusual in 1978. It was followed by an updated version, Star fire II, with fixes. It was then ported by Epyx to Commodore 64 and Atari 8-bit computers in a bundle with Fire One, another Exidy game. 

The player flies through starfields, zapping enemy starfighters out of existence. The player controls whether the ship is moving forward or backwards via a lever, and a control yoke translates the player's view left, right, up, or down. The player has a button that fires quad-linked lasers at a targeting reticle. The lasers travel slowly, taking about two seconds to reach their target, and only one shot can be in the air at once. Furthermore, each shot the player fires causes heat to build up in his ship. If the player's rate of fire is too high, the guns will overheat and need to cool down before they will fire again.

If the player can maneuver such that a TIE fighter-like ship is directly in the targeting reticle, the weapon will ""lock on"" and any shots fired will automatically hit. When the player successfully shoots an enemy fighter, the screen displays ""GOT HIM"". Occasionally, a thinner, horizontally oriented ship that looks like a Colonial Viper from Battlestar Galactica will be seen. These have ""Exidy"" written on their tails, and are worth the largest number of points. If the player successfully shoots this ship, the screen displays ""GOT US"". These ships can not be locked onto.

The game is timed and the more money is put in, the longer the player can play. As the player shoots enemy ships, they increase in skill, and also in point value. If the player reaches certain point thresholds, more fuel is obtained, extending play. The player's ship can be shot; this simply resets the quality of enemies (and thus their point value) down to the lowest level.

Player high scores are recorded at the end of each game. A novelty for an arcade game, players can input their initials next to their scores to mark the scores as theirs. Entering certain sets of initials into the high score table will cause the game to display certain messages. ""DBR"" will display ""HI DAVE"", ""SKO"" ""HI SUSAN"", and ""TZM"" ""HI TED""—a reference to the authors' names

Ted Michon, an alumnus of California Technical Institute, was a technician for the arcade company Digital Games/Micronetics. There, he created an early microprocessor game called Night Racer before leaving the company in 1976 to found his own arcade company called Techni-Cal. He hired David Rolfe, an assembly programmer from the Institute who had no interest in video games, but was willing to solve coding problems.

Michon was inspired by the spaceship battles in the film Star Wars, and devised a game that aimed to recreate the sense of freedom of space flight. Michon's girlfriend (and later wife), Susan Owen, was the game's artist. The assets drawn were heavily borrowed from Star Wars, from the logo and the TIE fighter-like enemy ships to the X-wing-like laser cannons on the player's ship. The developers had hoped that they could secure a Star Wars license, which would have made their product the first official Star Wars video game. Michon chose a monitor that could display up to eight colors. To achieve this end, he designed what was probably a ""color cell"" system that was similarly employed by Commodore 64. To save memory, compromises were made such as stars possibly changing from white to blue when enemy ships pass in front of them. Next, to create a 3D effect, using a technique called sprite-scaling, Owen would draw different images of the same enemy spacecraft, and Rolfe would switch the sprites with larger versions as they approached the player. The result required an enormous 21 ROM chips to store the graphics and code.

The developers entered a deal with Midway Manufacturing to publish the game, but Midway was unimpressed with the team's project, and its president, Hank Ross, suggested that the team replace the enemy starship with a witch on a bicycle in the style of The Wizard of Oz. Even with this change, however, the game was not considered to meet Midway's standards, and so it dropped the publishing deal. With no one to fund their project, Rolfe spent extra time at his second job at APh Technological Consulting, who was working to lay down the programming framework for what would become the Mattel Intellivision. Michon found and contacted Exidy, a small arcade company based in Sunnyvale, California who developed titles such as Death Race and Circus. Exidy, who sought to push technical boundaries, agreed to publish the game. ""Exidy"" wordmarks were added, including on the starship that replaced the witch, and the cabinet was designed to be sit-down for enhanced immersion. It was released as Star Fire in December 1978.

By March 1980, Exidy was in the stage of selling the last of its Star Fire cabinets.

Epyx ported Star Fire and another Exidy game, Fire One!, to the Atari 8-bit family and Commodore 64, and released them in 1983 as an arcade classics compilation.

Exidy created an update called Star Fire II which improved the high score table


Star Fire is remembered as the first game to allow players to enter their initials next to their high scores. It is also one of the few games where the copyright holder has granted permission to freely run the game in MAME for non-commercial purposes.

Star Fire appeared as a major plot element in Disney Studios' Midnight Madness, in which competing teams of college students hunting for treasure are led to an arcade to try to obtain a high score for this game in exchange for one of the clues to the treasure.

The current record for the high score is 9,780 points, set by Laura Curran of Las Vegas in January 1982. As of 2010 this was the oldest high score record in the Twin Galaxies arcade database.

On August 19, 2020, 41 years after its launch, David Rolfe uploaded the source code of the updated version of Star Fire, Star fire II, to the Internet Archive under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license."

However, some problems arise with a couple of alien races, so the Earth Federation begins its research in creating a Plasma-power weapon to help protect the Earth from any possible outside threats. Dr. Edward Bilstein: a Nobel Prize-winning German-American prestigious physicist for the Earth Federation, uncovers the secret to humanity's ""sixth sense"": a technique for capturing the energy of the human mind and discovers how to use it as an energy source he calls ""Plasma Power"". 

The specific Plasma weapon is built, using mental power as its basis and that Bilstein is able to gain fame and fortune for the invention, but it is soon discovered by the Earth Federation that Bilstein had experimented on actual human bodies during his research on Plasma Power and that he's immediately arrested and exiled from Earth, being imprisoned in a floating prison satellite that orbits the Planet Zeta while the development of the specific Plasma weapon is indefinitely suspended. Word of Earth's possession of a super weapon immediately spreads throughout the universe and that it instantly reduces hostile confrontations while the name Dr. Edward Bilstein is completely forgotten from within the minds of everyone. However, four years later, a report from Zeta states that an Earth Federation army base from upon the planet was attacked and immediately destroyed by a small group of rebels calling themselves the ""Fourth Empire"" and that Bilstein, who had built himself a powerful cyborg body and managed to escape from the floating prison satellite on Zeta, is the one who's leading this group of dangerous individuals. With several other similar reports coming from other nearby planets and realizing that the specific pattern of attacks is leading right back to Earth, a panicked Earth Federation has only one recourse: to find people who could utilize Plasma Power in their own given accord and attempt to stop Bilstein from within a last, desperate effort before the mad genius can invade and conquer Earth and the rest of the universe with his nascent Fourth Empire.

It was inspired by The House of the Dead and was based on the hit science fiction television show Star Trek: Voyager, which had aired on UPN from 1995-2001. 

Star Trek: Voyager — The Arcade Game is a House of the Dead-style light gun game played from the first-person shooter perspective. The player uses a light gun which can be aimed and fired at on-screen enemies. The reloading process is referred to as remodulation, a term used in Star Trek, and is done by shooting the gun off-screen.
Much of the game takes place on the USS Voyager, shooting various alien intruders such as the Borg, Hirogen Hunters, Species 8472 as well as several other alien species from the Star Trek universe. The game has several missions players can select as the game progresses. Some missions involve flight in the Delta Flyer, one of the shuttles used by the crew of the USS Voyager. During these sequences players attack Borg vessels such as Borg Cubes and Spheres. 

The game was generally released in a large game unit, known as the Deluxe cabinet version, or a stand-alone smaller unit was available for smaller sites where space was an issue. The Deluxe cabinet variant permitted players to sit down and was a fully enclosed unit. The cabinet was designed to be folded into four separate pieces for transport, with the roof being fully removable, as is the floor, and the ends of the game come ready on swivel wheels. The game was very successful onsite for operators and although the Star Trek Voyager series had finished some two years prior to its release. The original license from Paramount Pictures was obtained by Frank J. Pelligreni, President of Team Play Inc, and proved to be a very successful design and product for the company. The license and distribution of the game was granted only to the United States, so no units were exported outside of the US in brand new form, however, some units have been sold when 2nd hand and have made their way into collectors hands in Australia and possibly Japan, but less than half a dozen units, according to the game's original designer, Team Play Inc."

It is based on the movie, Star Wars, which was produced by Lucasfilm and released in theaters on May 25, 1977.

Assuming the role of Luke Skywalker (""Red Five""), the player pilots an X-wing fighter from a first-person perspective. The controls consist of a yoke control with four buttons — two trigger style and two in position to be pressed by the thumbs — each of which fired a laser positioned on the four leading edges of the X-Wings.

The player does not have to destroy every TIE Fighter and gun turret in order to advance through the game; instead, the player must survive for a set length of time, either avoiding or destroying enemies and the shots they fire. The player begins with six shields, one of which is lost for every collision with an enemy or projectile. If the player loses all shields and is hit again, the game ends.

Each wave of the game consists of three attack phases, culminating in the destruction of the Death Star.

Phase 1
In the first phase, the ""Imperial March"" or another part of John Williams' Star Wars score is briefly played electronically and the player engages in a dogfight with Darth Vader and enemy TIE fighters in outer space near the Death Star. After the TIE fighter waves, when flying towards the Death Star, the yellow grid lines on the Death Star spell out either ""May the force be with you"" on odd-numbered waves or names of some of the developers on even numbered waves.

Phase 2
In the second phase, the player must fly across the surface of the Death Star to reach its equatorial trench. This section is omitted during the first wave of the game. During the second wave the player is attacked by artillery bunkers, while in the third and subsequent waves laser turrets on towers rise to confront the player. The player is awarded a bonus for destroying every turret.

Phase 3
In the third phase, the player must navigate the trench until finally firing a proton torpedo for a direct hit on the exhaust port target. If the player is successful, the Death Star explodes and the player is awarded a bonus shield, to a maximum of six (can be set internally for a maximum of eight). Should the player fail to hit the exhaust port, a shield is lost and the player must attempt the trench again. If the player manages to destroy the Death Star without firing at anything but the exhaust port, a bonus is awarded for ""using the Force.""

The game then resets to the first phase. Each successive wave greatly increases the difficulty; TIE fighters shoot more often, artillery bunkers and laser towers appear in the second phase, and obstacles appear in the trench during the third. Unlike the movie, where the units shoot beams similar to lasers, the enemy units in this game shoot projectiles resembling fireballs, which give the player a chance of destroying the shots."

Stargate is the sequel to the 1980 arcade video game, Defender.

The player flies a small spaceship above a scrolling, mountainous landscape which wraps around, so flying constantly in one direction will eventually return to the starting point. The player's ship flies in front of the landscape and does not contact it.

The terrain is inhabited by a small number of humanoids. Enemy ships fly overhead. The goal is to destroy the enemies to prevent the humans from being captured.

The player is armed with a beam-like weapon which can be fired rapidly in a long horizontal line ahead of the spaceship, and also has a limited supply of smart bombs, which can destroy every enemy on the screen. The player also has a limited supply of ""Inviso"" cloaking energy, which makes the ship invisible, and able to destroy any ships it comes in contact with.

At the top of the screen is a mini-map, which displays the positions of all aliens and humans on the landscape.

Aliens
There are fifteen types of aliens:
Lander - the primary enemy on every level. Landers teleport into the level in staggered waves, and attempt to capture humanoids by descending upon them and dragging them into the air; if they make it to the top of the screen with a human, the two fuse together into a more dangerous Mutant. Landers can fire projectiles at the player.
Mutant - a mutated Lander. Mutants home in on the player at constant speed, firing projectiles. They move erratically, making them difficult to shoot.
Baiter - a flat, iridescent spacecraft that teleports in if the player is taking too long to complete a level. Homes in on the player and attempts to match their speed, while firing accurate projectiles. A difficult opponent due to its unbeatable speed and tiny horizontal cross-section, which makes it very hard to shoot.
Bomber - a box-shaped alien that lays stationary mines in the air.
Pod - a star-like alien that bursts into a number of Swarmers when shot.
Swarmer - a tiny teardrop-shaped alien that moves very quickly in an undulating fashion. Difficult to shoot.
Firebomber - a rotating variation on the Bomber, which shoots high speed Fireballs at the player.
Yllabian Space Guppie - an undulating attacker, which attacks in swarms and homes in on the ship.
Phreds and Big Reds - square aliens which look like they are constantly opening and closing their mouths. Similar to the Firebombers, they launch tiny versions of themselves called Munchies.
Dynamos - diamond-shaped ships composed of clusters of Space Hums, which periodically break off to attack the ship independently. Once all aliens (except Fireballs, Space Hums, Baiters, Phreds, Big Reds, and Munchies) are destroyed, the player progresses to the next level.

Humanoids
The game starts with ten Humanoids inhabiting the planet. Landers will attempt to capture and fuse with them during play.

To rescue a Humanoid from capture, the player must kill the Lander holding it while it is in the air, causing the Humanoid to drop. At low height Humanoids can survive the drop on their own, but if the Lander is killed at too high an altitude, the player must catch the Humanoid with their ship and return him to the ground, otherwise he will not survive the drop. A player's ship can carry as many Humanoids as are alive on that level.

The Humanoids can be killed by the player's weapon just as easily as the aliens can, so careful aim is required when firing near them.

If all Humanoids are killed, the entire planet explodes, leaving the player in empty space. This also has the unfortunate effect of turning every Lander into a Mutant, making the player's job very difficult.

Every time the player completes 5 waves of enemies (i.e. at wave 6, 11, 16 and so forth), the planet (and all its 10 Humanoids) is restored.

Scoring
As well as the points gained by killing aliens, scores are also awarded as follows:

Humanoid falling back to the ground without dying: 250 points
Catching a falling humanoid: 500, 1000, 1,500, and 2,000 points, depending on number of humanoids carried at the time.
Returning a humanoid to the ground: 500 points
Humanoid surviving the level: 100 points per humanoid for 1st wave, 200 per humanoid on 2nd wave, up to a maximum of 500 points from 5th wave onwards
End-of-wave humanoid bonus: If all enemies are destroyed and a humanoid is falling to the ground, the player receives a 2,000 point bonus if the ship is positioned at ground level directly under the humanoid, so as to simultaneously catch the humanoid and place it back on the ground. If the player simply catches the humanoid in mid-air while above the ground, the wave ends with the player only receiving the 500 points for catching the humanoid.
If the player accumulates 999 ships and gets awarded another ship, the counter wraps around, eliminating all ships but the one being awarded, and the one currently being played with.
By default, the player receives an extra life, smart bomb, and Inviso energy every 10,000 points. This amount can be overridden when the machine is in maintenance mode. As in Defender, at 9,990,000, those bonuses are given for every enemy destroyed.

Controls
The control system of Stargate expands on that of Defender. The game has a joystick to move up and down, a Reverse button to toggle the player's horizontal direction, and a Thrust button to move in that direction. There is also a Fire button for shooting, a button to activate a Smart Bomb, a button to turn on the Inviso cloaking device, and a Hyperspace button which teleports the player to a random position in the level, at the risk of either exploding upon rematerialization, or materializing onto an enemy or enemy projectile, and then exploding.

The Stargate
A central feature of the gamefield is the Stargate itself, represented by a series of concentric rectangles. The operation of the Stargate depends on the current game conditions.

If a Lander is in the process of abducting a Humanoid, flying into the Stargate will teleport the ship to where the Humanoid is under attack. If more than one Humanoid is being captured, the ship will be taken to the Lander that is closest to the top of the screen. If a Humanoid is being captured while a Humanoid is falling to the ground, the ship will be taken to the Humanoid that is falling to the ground. Otherwise, entering the Stargate will teleport the ship to the opposite side of the planet.

If the ship is carrying at least four humanoids, entering the Stargate will ""warp"" the game ahead three levels. This allows more advanced players to skip the easier lower levels and also get a great number of points, extra lives, smart bombs, and inviso energy. Warping is only allowed in the first 10 levels, and can be avoided (if desired) by flying into the Stargate in reverse, allowing a player to continue on the current level."

The players can shoot absolutely anything on the screen, including all background objects and even innocent bystanders; however, if they should do the latter, it will cause them to lose energy. Both players are armed with two weapons - a machine gun with unlimited ammunition and a limited number of missiles (four at the start of the game, with another four being awarded at the end of each act). When launched, the missiles will damage or destroy everything on screen (including innocent bystanders); but if an innocent bystander crosses the screen unharmed, the players will regain a small amount of energy. The players will also regain energy at the end of each act, depending on how accurate their shooting was - and unlike in most other shooters, shooting at background objects does not count towards accuracy or add to the players' scores. Upon reaching the final battle with STURM's leader (named Gatse Bernard), players must try to destroy him without running out of energy, as the game will not let them continue if they run out at that point."

From mankind's birth, they had watched a distant star that mysteriously glimmered in the night sky. At times, it was nearly invisible, a pitch black. At others, it gleamed brilliantly. Tales of the enigmatic star, passed on from generation to generation like prophecies from mythical times, continue to be told in modern times.
And the star was named ""Vower.""
Stranian civilization progressed rapidly over the ages, soon reaching levels of scientific achievements that allowed them to understand the true nature of Vower. They found that the star was actually an artificial planet, some three light-years away, created by a far more sophisticated and advanced race of artificial beings. Completely mechanical, the planet was testimony that the alien culture was vastly superior to that of Strania.
The discovery instantly caused panic throughout Strania. Did mankind exist on Vower? If so, what would become of their home planet?
However, for the Stranian people, and likely for those of Vower as well, the distance between the two planets was immense.
Time passed and several hundred years later, because of the knowledge of Vower's existence, Stranian civilization advancements surged, even more quickly than before.
********************************
The dawn of the space exploration era

Mankind departed Strania in order to explore the space around it, successfully landed on nearby moons and planets. In the year 380 PD (Post Discovery), scientists completed research that would become the foundation of developing ""quantum jump"" technology, which would allow high-speed, long-distance space travel. Stranians had finally taken a step toward reaching Vower.
Just five years later, however, Strania would confirm the presence of a mass of colossal magnitude coming closer and closer to their home planet.
Vower and Strania had overcome the abyss of time and made contact.


April 23, 392 PD
Operation ""Stella Shooter""

By positioning a base, codenamed ""NS-032,"" on the frontline, the Vower army controlled the space over planet Strania. In order for Stranians to retake the area, destroying NS-032 was of utmost importance. However, to accomplish that feat, they would first have to eliminate ""Gunrock,"" Vower's enormous particle weapon that was aimed directly at their planet. Even with the fleet of warships that the Stranians commanded, they had to destroy the weapon in order to give themselves a chance to win the war.
A covert operation was developed, centering on the elite special task force - the Stella Machina.
*************
Decree of Operation Stella Shooter ?

Operation details:
1) The 3rd Space Division departs from Strania. At the same time, the Stella Machina also departs to make a preemptive strike on the Vower army.
2) Assuming Vower forces occupying the stratosphere engage in battle, the Stella Machina is to breakthrough the front lines and infiltrate the inner Orbital Ring.
3) After confirming that Gunrock has begun preparations to attack the fleet, the Stella Machina is to approach the weapon and destroy its energy system, thereby eliminating its ability to function.
4) All remaining forces are to join together and make a unified assault on NS-032.

It is clear that annihilating Gunrock is vital to the success of the operation. To you, selected members of special task force Sterna Machina, the fate of the mission, and of all Strania, rides on your shoulders. May you fight bravely and fulfill your duty!"

It is the second entry in the Street Fighter series and the arcade sequel to the original Street Fighter released in 1987. It is Capcom's fourteenth title that runs on the CP System arcade hardware. Street Fighter II improves upon the many concepts introduced in the first game, including the use of command-based special moves and a six-button configuration, while offering players a selection of multiple playable characters, each with their own unique fighting style, and introducing a combo system and competitive multiplayer combat between two players.

The success of Street Fighter II is credited with starting the fighting-game boom during the 1990s which inspired other game developers to produce their own fighting-game franchises, popularizing the genre, and setting off a renaissance for the arcade game industry in the early 1990s. The game is widely considered among critics to be one of the greatest fighting games as well as one of the greatest video games ever made. It was then ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System platform, for which it became a long-lasting system-seller. Its success led to a subseries of updated versions, each offering additional features and characters over previous versions, as well as several home versions.

By 1994, the game had been played by at least 25 million people in the United States, at home and in arcades. The video game console ports sold more than 14 million copies worldwide; the Super NES port of the original game sold 6.3 million units, making it Capcom's best-selling single consumer game software until 2013 (when it was surpassed by Resident Evil 5) and remaining their best-selling game software on a single platform through to the present day.

Skate had arrived at home from school and was shocked to find his house in ruin and his older brother missing. Attached to the front door was a picture of Adam chained to a wall at the feet of Mr. X. The criminals began to retake the streets once more. Beatings and lootings took place regularly and in broad daylight. Chaos reigned in the city, far worse than before.

Realizing that Mr. X and his syndicate have returned for revenge against them and the city, Axel and Skate waste no time in telling Blaze about the unexpected situation and Blaze herself is determined to help Axel out in defeating Mr. X and rescuing Adam.

It is a sequel to G-LOC: Air Battle, which itself is now seen as a spin-off of the After Burner franchise.

Strike Fighter, like G-LOC primarily takes place from a cockpit view, where the player is tasked with shooting down enemy planes (while making sure not to be shot down themselves). Also like G-LOC, the game pans out to a third-person perspective if an enemy is on your tail. The major difference between the two is that whereas G-LOC uses a goal-based mission system, Strike Fighter's levels are similar in design to After Burner's, simply finishing when the player reaches a certain distance.

Strike Fighter saw most of its content re-branded as After Burner III for the Sega Mega-CD. The main difference between the two from a gameplay perspective is that After Burner III always gives users the option of playing from a third-person perspective.

It is the first commercial video game in stereoscopic 3-D, using a periscope-shaped display with a different image for each eye. It was jointly developed by Sega and Matsushita Electric (now Panasonic), who developed its active shutter 3D system. The game has stereo sound, and also changes the backdrop to reflect day, night, dawn, and dusk.
The game was a commercial success for Sega in arcades. It was adapted for ColecoVision, as SubRoc, with simulated 3D effects, by Arnold Hendrick and Philip Taterczynski of the Coleco game design staff, with programming by David Wesely of 4D Interactive Systems.

The stereoscopic 3D effect is achieved with an active shutter 3D system. It uses a special eyepiece, a viewer with spinning discs to alternate left and right images to the player's eyes from a single monitor. The player's face is pressed against the eyepiece, which is shaped like a submarine periscope and attached to a controller below. The game's pseudo-3D visuals are created with scaled sprites using the VCO Object hardware, previously used in Sega's 1981 racing game Turbo.

The game's active-shutter 3-D technology was developed by Matsushita Electric (now Panasonic) for a 3D television they had developed in the late 1970s and unveiled in 1981. The game began development around 1980, when Sega and Matsushita began discussing a ""Stereo Viewer System"" to adapt Matsushita's 3D television for video game use. Sega's director of technology for the project was Shikanosuke Ochi, who previously led the development of 1966 arcade electro-mechanical game Periscope. At the Amusement & Music Operators Association (AMOA) show in 1981, 3D images from the game were demonstrated on video tape.

Sega held a press conference on February 20, 1982 and demonstrated the first trial unit at the NOA Expo on March 1, 1982, the date when the game was first published. Several game changes were made before it entered mass-production in Japan on July 2, 1982, in North America in August 1982, and in Europe by January 1983"

Sunset Riders can be played by up to two or four players, depending on the version of the game. In the two-player version each player can choose which of the four bounty hunters to play as at the start of the game, while in the four-player version each character is assigned to a different control panel.

Super Cobra is the sequel to the 1981 arcade video game, Scramble.

The player controls a helicopter through tight caverns, and the slightest misstep will result in the loss of a life. However, unlike Scramble, the game can be continued where the player left off by adding more credits and pressing FIRE (but he/she loses all points upon continuing).

The joystick accelerates, decelerates, moves up, and moves down. The helicopter uses a laser and bomb to destroy defenders, tanks, and UFOs while infiltrating 10 Super Cobra defense systems.

The ship has a limited fuel supply, which is depleted over time. More fuel can be acquired by destroying fuel tanks in the game.

The game is divided into ten sections, plus a finale, each with a different style of terrain and different obstacles. Players navigate through ten levels and a base, where they must safely make it through the level and remove the booty. The levels are described as follows:

Player must maneuver the chopper over mountainous terrain against fast and slow firing rockets.
Chopper faces Arcing missiles over a mountain terrain.
Smart Bombs flying in groups of four over mountainous terrain. Rockets appear, but do not fire.
Single Smart Bombs over mountainous terrain. Again, Rockets appear, but do not fire.
Chopper flies through a cavern-like terrain against falling mines.
Rapidly firing, roving tanks over mountainous terrain. Rockets appear, but do not fire.
Maneuver through a field of meteors which explode when hit with bombs or 3 times with laser, plus a single, green, shadow meteor directly in front of chopper which explodes when hit five times with laser. Rockets appear but do not fire.
Chopper flies over mountainous terrain against rapidly firing UFOs. Tanks and rockets appear, but do not fire.
Chopper faces arcing missiles over tall buildings.
Firing rockets in a building maze.
Base: Player must maneuver the chopper over tall buildings against arcing missiles and rapidly firing tanks to reach the Booty and safely carry it away. If the mission is successful, an extra copter is given (plus one when 10,000 points are scored).

There is no intermission between each section; the game simply scrolls into the new terrain. If the player destroys the booty on the final level, he/she must start back at the beginning of the level.

If the booty is safely carried away, the player starts back at the beginning of the first level and the cycle repeats. On the second time through the levels, the tanks fire much more aggressively and fuel is consumed much faster. On the third and subsequent times through the levels, fuel is consumed still faster. The faster rate of fuel consumption on the second and subsequent cycles may make it difficult to complete those cycles without losing at least one chopper due to running out of fuel, although this is compensated somewhat by awarding an extra chopper each time a cycle is completed and the booty is carried away."

"Super Dodge Ball '96","","Region Not Set","","","Technos","1996-05-01","2","No","Action | Fighting","","Two teams battle each other out, with each team restricted to their side of the court, attacking each other with a ball, until all the members of one team are all eliminated. This time, teams are composed of only three members: a captain and two teammates. When a character's vitality gauge runs out completely, instead of being eliminated completely from the match, they are moved to the opposing team's outfield, where they can still assist their remaining teammates by attacking them from within the opposing side of the court. The Power Shots in the game are now performed by inputting fighting game-style commands. The captains in each team have two Power Shots, a Counter Shot, a Special Pass, and a Super Power Shot that can only be performed when the team's power gauge is completely filled. The generic teammates only have one power shot each.

The controls of the game changes depending on whether the player's team is in possession with the ball (offense) or without it (defense). During offense mode, the player can shoot the ball at the opposing team, pass it to a teammate, jump, or feint a shot. In defense mode, the player can try to catch an opponent's shot, crouch to avoid, jump, or provoke. Pressing the A and B simultaneously in defense mode will cause the player's current character to charge the power gauge (which is normally filled when the player performs Power Shots). When two members of opposing teams pick up the ball at the same, they will be prompted to press any button rapidly until one character overpowers the other and gets a free shot.

In the single-player mode, the player starts out by choosing from one of seven teams and then face against the other teams.

Super Pac-Man is the fourth game in the Pac-Man series and the second game in the Pac-Man series to be developed by Namco in Japan.

Sound and gameplay mechanics were altered radically from the first two entries into the Pac-Man series—instead of eating dots, the player is required to eat keys in order to open doors, which open up sections of the maze that contain what in earlier games were known as ""fruits"" (foods such as apples and bananas, or other prizes such as Galaxian flagships), which are now the basic items that must be cleared. Once all the food is eaten, the player advances to the next level, in which the food is worth more points. In earlier levels, keys unlock nearby doors, while as the player progresses through the levels, it is more common for keys to open faraway doors. Pac-Man can enter the ghost house at any time without a key.

In addition to the original power pellets which allow Pac-Man to eat the ghosts, two ""Super"" pellets are available and will turn Pac-Man into Super Pac-Man for a short time. In this form, he becomes much larger, can move with increased speed when the ""Super Speed"" button is held down and has the ability to eat through doors without unlocking them. He is also invulnerable to the ghosts, who appear thin and flat in order to give the illusion of Super Pac-Man ""flying"" over them. He still cannot eat them without the help of the original power-up. When Super Pac-Man is about to revert to regular Pac-Man, he flashes white. The Super power can then be prolonged by eating a power pellet or super pellet, if available.

A point bonus can be scored if Pac-Man eats a star that appears between the two center boxes while assorted symbols flash inside them. Usually, one symbol stops while the other continues until the star is eaten, a life is lost, or too much time elapses. If the star is eaten when two symbols match, the bonus is 2000 points for any match, and 5000 points if the matching symbols are the same as the level being played. Otherwise, the bonus is similar to the award for eating a ghost, which is 200, 400, 800 or 1600 points, depending on the level. (On some versions, higher levels might pay out the 2000 or 5000 points no matter what the symbols are.)

Bonus levels appear at intervals. Here, the player is presented with a maze full of food items and must eat them all in order to collect the points on a countdown timer. Pac-Man appears in Super Mode throughout the stage, and there should be no ghosts."

"Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo","","Region Not Set","","Capcom","Capcom","1996-05-31","2","No","Puzzle","","The basic premise of SPF2T has the player stacking down gems two at a time Tetris style and is always played with two players either Human or Computer. The goal is to explode the different colored gems with the matching Exploding gems by fitting them next to each other. If any of the same colored gems are adjacent to that gem vertically or horizontally, they will explode in a chain reaction. If at anytime four of the same colored gem is matched in a 2X2 fashion, they will conglomerate into one giant gem. The bigger then gem the more points one can score when the matching color of exploding gem is attached. This is a very High Risk, High Reward puzzle game, in that the bigger sets of gems, the less work space you get. The reward is when exploded, the gems will move onto the opponents playing field. When gems hit the opponents side, the gems start off as gem counters with a number on them and a color. Every time the opponent drops a set of blocks on his side the counter will drop by one. This See-Saw style battle goes back and forth until one of the players has no more room to drop gems.

Occasionally the game will drop down a Multicolored Diamond gem. Any color that the bottom point of this diamond touches will explode without having the need to be adjacent to it. As a result, the Diamond gem is best used when in a tight situation or a lead up to a chain combo as when exploded gems disappear, they fall prey to the laws of physics. Any Counter gems that get sent to the playing field via the Diamond gem only start the counter at half the amount rather than the full amount, thus reiterating the High Risk, High Reward strategy.

There are 8 main characters you can play as. 4 are taken from the Street Fighter series ( Ryu, Ken, Chun Li and Sakura) and 4 are from the Darkstalkers series ( Morrigan, Donovan, Felicia and Hsien-ko) Character selection is more important then just aesthetics in this puzzle game as it determines the pattern of the gems you drop on your opponents side. Your fighter was represented by a super deformed tiny version of your character who stood next to your puzzle board and would do their signature special attacks when you did a fair amount of damage. They were just for show and had no effect on the game.

Gameplay
It is as a side-scrolling shooter unlike its predecessor Super Spacefortress Macross, and geared more towards competitive play. The player characters are still fixed per side: Player 1 is Silvie, Player 2 is Nexx.
There are 10 levels total, split between the difficulty levels ""Beginner"" ""Medium"" and ""Expert"" respectively, with only the final level being shared by all.
The overall game is built on a ""score attack"" system, requiring the player to meet the minimum quota indicated at the top-center part of the screen before time runs out. Failure to do so will result in a game over. Enemies will continue to appear even if the target score has already been achieved, moving to the next level only after the timer expires. This is also true for stages with boss fights.
For co-op play, the sum of Player 1 and 2's respective scores contribute to the quota. The 1P vs 2P mode is set in a player-selected stage, with 9 out of the ten stages available. The object is to score higher than the other player within the given time. The winner will be granted extended play.
Power-ups are still used to change forms, but the Battroid Mode is only seen for a short while when using the screen-clearing bomb (which looks more like a rapid missile barrage), meaning that the Fighter and Gerwalk modes are constant for most of the game. Mode power-ups picked while in the same form will increase attack power. If power is maxed out, it will become a bonus item worth 3000 points. There is no ""Armored"" form this time. 

Notes And Trivia
    In the mode select screen, Silvie and Nexx are written as ""Serbee"" and ""Necks"" respectively.
    Despite the OVA base being set in an alternate universe, Minmay Dolls and Tuna Heads make an appearance here as well, reprising their role as bonus point items."

"Super Tank","","Region Not Set","","SNK","Video Games GmbH","1981-01-01","2","No","Shooter","","Super Tank is one of two original games manufactured by German company Video Games GmbH. Released in 1981, it was licensed to SNK for the Japanese market and Computran for the US Market.

In Super Tank, up to two players simultaneously control highly mobile armored tanks on a mission to destroy the SUPER TANK. An introductory collection round challenges the players to clear a field of mines and destroy as many red enemy tanks as possible. Special glowing diamonds are scattered throughout, providing temporary super armor protection and making the players’ task easier.

After clearing the field of mines, the players are ready for their confrontation with the SUPER TANK! The SUPER TANK is this game’s most dangerous adversary. It is a highly-maneuverable vehicle with a single weakness at the tip of its nozzle. A direct hit on the nozzle will destroy the SUPER TANK, bringing the players to another more intricate collection round where the challenges are greater and so are the rewards.

Oddly enough, the German and Japanese versions of the game’s flyer depict a flower-laden, treaded vehicle with the head and body of a Roman gentleman, much like a centaur. This vehicle is shown shooting water at other similar vehicles out of his elongated nose. It is thought that restrictions against war games and cultural standards were responsible for these gentle depictions of the military-themed action in the game."

A maze game where the player controls a large blue cell that zaps medicine into the veins. Each vein that is zapped will disappear from the maze.

Game Introduction
The game consists of eight mazes formed by rectangular veins and thin golden cell membranes. Each succeeding maze is more complex than the preceding maze.
The enemies consist of four differently colored viruses. The player must avoid or zap the viruses. The color of the first virus zapped determines the color of the reborn viruses. When all viruses are the same color, they can no longer be zapped.
When the last membrane is zapped, Aid Stations briefly appear in the four corners of the screen. The player must collect extra zaps by reaching the corner before the Aid Stations revert to veins. Each time a player reaches an Aid Station, a baby cell is awarded. When the player receives five baby cells, an extra large blue cell is awarded.

Game Play
The player must zap all veins in each maze before runing out of zaps or cell life. If the player fails, a cell will be lost. When all veins in a maze are zapped, a bonus is awarded and the player will advance to the next maze.
If the player successfully completes all eight mazes, the game will repeat with more viruses present."

The controls consist of a four-position joystick and a tap handle. The game screen features four bars, each with a keg at one end and a door at the other. Customers enter through the doors and slowly advance toward the kegs, demanding service. The player controls a bartender who must pour drinks and slide them down the bar for the customers to catch. Pushing the joystick up or down instantly moves the bartender to the keg at the next bar in the chosen direction, with the top and bottom of the screen wrapping around to one another, while pushing left or right causes him to run along the bar where he is stationed. When the tap handle is pulled down, the bartender instantly moves to the keg (if he is not already standing there) and fills a mug; releasing it causes him to slide the mug along the bar.

Customers slide back toward the doors upon catching a full mug, and disappear through the doors if they are close enough. If not, they stop after a certain distance, consume the drink, and resume their advance while sliding the empty mug back toward the keg. Customers occasionally leave tips on the bar, which the player can pick up for bonus points. Collecting a tip causes a group of female dancers to appear for a few seconds, distracting a portion of the customers so that they will stop advancing. However, distracted customers cannot catch drinks, and any customers who are either drinking or being pushed back at the start of the dancers' show will never be distracted.

One life is lost when any of the following occurs:
The player fails to catch an empty mug before it falls off the keg end of a bar and breaks.
A full mug slides to the door end of a bar without being caught, where it falls and breaks.
Any customer reaches the keg end of a bar, whereupon they grab the bartender and slide him across the bar out the door.

Each screen is completed when the bar is completely emptied of customers. The bartender then pours/consumes a drink of his own with humorous results involving the empty mug, such as getting it stuck on his head or stubbing his toe when he tries to kick it. As the game progresses, the customers appear more frequently, move faster along the bar, and are pushed back shorter distances when they catch their drinks. In addition, the maximum number of customers per bar gradually increases until every bar can have up to four customers at a time.

The player proceeds through four levels, each with its own theme and appropriately dressed customers, and must complete a set number of screens to advance from one level to the next. The levels are:
A western saloon with cowboys (2 screens)
A sports bar with athletes (3 screens)
A punk rock bar with punk rockers (4 screens)
An outer-space bar with aliens (4 screens)

A bonus round is played after the end of each level, in which six cans of beer (or root beer) are placed on the bar. A masked figure shakes five of the cans, then pounds the bar to shuffle them. Choosing the one unshaken can awards bonus points, while choosing any other results in the bartender being sprayed in the face; in the latter case, the unshaken can flashes briefly to indicate its position.

After completing all four levels, the player returns to the start of the sequence and continues the game at a higher difficulty level."
"Targ","","Region Not Set","","Exidy, Inc.","Exidy, Inc.","1980-10-01","2","No","Shooter","","Targ is a one or two player shooter game released by Exidy in 1980. Your town is invaded by Targ riders, you must manouvre the heroic vehicle Whummel to destroy them. From time to time, a Spectar comes into screen, and can be destroyed for extra bonus.

Action takes place into a 9x9 grid, ""Crystal City"", where the player's vehicle must avoid and chase down 10 enemy wedge-shaped vehicles. When all enemies are destroyed, you are awarded an extra bonus and can access the following level. Two players can alternate in the game. You use a 4 way joystick to control the Whummel, and a pushbutton to fire at enemies. Progressing in the gameplay causes the Targs to become faster and smarter, for a fast and furious gameplay.

A small trivia on the game and characters name: apparently, Targ stands for Target, Spectar stands for Special Target.

While in that period many western companies licensed games from japanese developers (Exidy itself licensed Nintendo's Sheriff as Bandido) targ is one of the few western games that made it in the opposite way, being licensed by Sega for japanese distribution.

This game has a sequel, always released in 1980, Spectar."

Pressing the ""change"" button allows Tecmo Knight to switch between the two. Smokeman uses powerful punches and kicks against enemies while Tecmo Knight rides him. While riding the tiger, Tecmo Knight has the use of a spiked ball and chain less powerful than Smokeman's attacks, but with greater range. When collecting the special dragon skull that randomly appears after defeating an enemy, the Tecmo Knight will summon the most powerful creature to ride on in the game: the Flying Dragon. Tecmo Knight is immune to attack while riding Flying Dragon, whose breath kills any monster in the game instantly, including the stage-end bosses. Using the ""jump and attack"" maneuver, Tecmo Knight can bound Smokeman or the tiger onto enemies and pummel them.

Sometimes, if Tecmo Knight runs low on life, a blow by a weak monster will kill only Smokeman or the tiger, leaving Tecmo Knight to fend for himself with a very weak short-ranged attack. It is extremely hard for him to survive at this point. All bosses in the game appear in ""pairs"" making it harder for a single player to corner them. The only exception is the last boss. Currently, there are two ""extra life"" bonus skulls known to exist in the game. Players can also utilize ""props"" like bombs and stone-rollers placed around the map to their advantage.

Much like the 1988 arcade beat 'em up Ninja Gaiden, Tecmo Knight is hard for beginners, because it requires more patience than button-pounding. Like Ninja Gaiden, the game features a rather disturbing continue screen, where Tecmo Knight is about to be swallowed by an unseen monster. If the player does not continue before the 10 second countdown ends, Tecmo Knight is heard screaming as the monster swallows him. Afterwards, the screen will black out, and a monster will tear through the screen shouting ""NO FUTURE!"", along with ""Game Over"" appearing under the monster."

If the player does not collect each shrunken monster quickly, it turns into a time-eating bug which flies to the time limit bar and consumes a chunk of it.

The blaster is also equipped with a ""Superzapper"" which, once per level, destroys all enemies currently on the field, a second use of the Superzapper in the same level destroys one random enemy. The Superzapper is recharged between each level.

The game features sixteen unique levels of different shapes, including simple geometric shapes, a flat line, and the symbol for infinity. Some levels are closed tubes that allow the player to loop throughout it continuously, while others have definite left and right endpoints. When all sixteen levels have been played, the sequence repeats with a different color scheme and higher difficulty. One set of levels (65 through 80) is ""invisible"" (black). After reaching Stage 99, the level counter stops increasing and each successive level shape is picked randomly.

Enemies first appear on the screen as swirling dots beyond the far end of the field, appearing on the field one at a time. There are seven types of enemies in the game, each with their own behavior pattern. Flippers attempt to catch the player's blaster and drag it to the far end of the playfield. Pulsars periodically electrify the lane that they occupy—if the blaster is in that lane at that moment, it is destroyed. Fuseballs jump forward and back unpredictably along the edges of each lane, moving slowly between them to give the player a brief opportunity to shoot them. Spikers roll toward the player and extend spikes into a lane, which the player can wear down by shooting it. After the first few levels, each level starts with short spikes at the far end of the field. Later levels also feature Fuseball and Pulsar Tankers, which split into two Fuseballs or two Pulsars when hit, respectively. Most enemies can shoot bullets at the blaster, destroying it upon impact.

When all enemies on the field have been destroyed, the player ""warps"" to the next level by traveling down the field and into the space beyond it. The player must avoid or destroy any spikes that are in the way; hitting one will destroy the blaster and force the player to try the warp again.

The player loses a life when their blaster is destroyed or captured, and the game ends when all lives are lost. Bonus blasters (up to six at a time) are awarded at certain score intervals."

It's a maze, of sorts, and it's one hell of an irritating game. In fact, it is one of the most irritating games that most will ever come across. But it does have its charms, namely its offbeat gameplay.

The graphics are bright and colorful, with a lot of eye candy everywhere. Depending on your point of view, this may or may not be a good thing, as all that coloring and eye candy has been designed specifically to distract you from beating the level. All that glitter is isolated to the areas immediately surrounding the track, and if you look off the beaten path you'll notice that the graphics there are quite sparse and simplistic.

The sound and music are passable, though not particularly good. The Irritating Maze's songs sound like generic puzzle game music and are generally pretty forgettable, but they do fit the game's mood. You'll hear an announcer's voice at certain points of the game telling you that you've passed a checkpoint or something like that. 

The announcer sounds reasonably excited, though if you listen you can hear a little bit of electronic fuzz distorting the voice clips. One sound clip stands out above the rest though, and that's the electric zap effect that plays when you lose. When this clip is combined with the associated graphics, the effect is literally shocking.

One of the biggest reasons why the game is so irritating is that you have to control your character's conducting rod with a trackball. For most people, the trackball is not an ideal input device for precise control, especially when put under the stress of time limits. A digital joystick or D-pad would actually allow you to have more precise control, but then having to deal with unfamiliar controls is part of the ""fun."" 

At first you'll find the innovative gameplay to be a lot of fun, much like Marble Madness. But unlike Marble Madness, The Irritating Maze's gameplay gets old relatively quickly, and you'll find yourself not caring enough to give the level another go. The Irritating Maze is different enough to be entertaining for a couple of minutes but not quite polished enough to be a lot of fun for the long haul. Give it a quarter or two and see how you do."

The game takes place during the Bakumatsu era in Japan, and incorporates various elements of Japanese mythology (with a heavy emphasis on the symbology of the Four Symbols). As such, the background music generally incorporates synthesized instruments simulating a sound appropriate to the 19th century setting, in a Western classical, pseudo-Romantic style (unusual for a fighting game).

The Last Blade series is seen as a spiritual successor to SNK's popular Samurai Shodown series, due to it being a similar 2D weapons-based fighting game. The gameplay is characterised by two selectable fighting styles, and a unique combo system along with a ""deflect"" system which involves pressing the D button at an opponents attack. Upon deflecting, the opponent is left open to attack.

The two styles consist of two modes: Speed mode and Power mode. Speed mode allows players to chain several normal attacks into a special or desperation/super move, as well as execute a Speed Combo. Power mode on the other hand, grants the player increased damage potential exponentially and giving access to Super Desperation Moves which inflict an exorbitant amount of damage (the prerequisites to performing them however, requires the player's life bar to flash and have a full power bar). Power mode also allows the player to perform Super Cancels; canceling a special move into a desperation/super move (but not a desperation move, with the sole exception of Awakened Kaede in the first game)."

The player's main weapon is an unlimited supply of missiles which travel a max distance of half the screen's height. The player also has two bombs which destroy all objects within a large circular radius. These bombs can be blown off by enemy bullets. The player is killed after only one hit, and is re-spawned to a point approximately one whole vertical screen-length later, thus progressing the player past the obstacle that had killed him, albeit at a high cost. The player is given three lives initially and bonus lives are awarded at 20000 points and every 80000 points thereafter. Flashing crosses scattered throughout each level award players power-ups depending on which color the cross is. A red cross will gives the player one side-firing mini-heli which shoots perpendicular to the player's helicopter. A white cross yields a forward firing mini-heli. It is possible to have a mix and match of side-helis, totaling no more than two. The green cross will award the player with an additional bomb, if the player currently has less than two. Grabbing power-ups when not necessary yields 5000 points.

There are a total of four stages, all of which start and end with a helipad. After completion of the last stage, the game will restart in a more difficult mode starting on stage 2.

The player must pursue the villain across time through the ages overcoming various obstacles along the way while undoing all the damage done by Vulcor. 

GAMEPLAY
The gameplay of Time Traveler is similar to that of other laserdisc games such as Dragon's Lair. The player moves a joystick in a specific direction or presses a button at certain points in the game. By entering the correct command, a movie clip plays showing the player's character progression through the game, while the wrong move results in a unique death scene for each segment. The game offers a short tutorial and hints on gameplay.
The player controls consist of a 4-way joystick, an action button and a time reversal button. The latter is a feature that allows the player to rewind and repeat the last few seconds of a failed segment. This gives the player a second chance to try and escape his death without having to repeat the complete Full-motion video (FMV) sequence all over again. Between levels, players can buy more time-reversal cubes by inserting more coins into the arcade machine.
The game starts with three lives and one time-reversal cube, lasting potentially ten minutes of perfect gameplay. Sometimes the game sequences have intentional latency, and ""time malfunction"" is displayed. It has a total of seven levels called ""time periods"". Every level consists of randomized FMV sequences within a time era theme such as pre-historic, Middle Ages, the future, and the Age of Magic.
As the game progresses players randomly encounter a slot machine mini-game called ""Hellgate"" where the player can bet a life to win or lose extra lives or a free credit, or lose the whole game. 

DEVELOPMENT
The game's action sequences were filmed in San Diego, California, with forty actors and a small production crew of about five people headed by Producer/Director Mark E. Watson of Fallbrook, California. The game takes place across many iconic settings from different time periods. All the game's footage was shot as if it were a live action movie. Few props were used during filming as the actors had to imagine fantastical locations while being filmed in front of a green screen stage. Some actors performed multiple roles, for example, the same actor played the obese ""amazon queen"" in the bonus DVD features and a chainsaw-wielding character in the game. The game's special effects, music and character voices were later added at a special effects studio in Carlsbad, California.
The arcade version has two easter eggs: Pressing both game buttons while pressing down on the joystick with a credit on the machine shows Rick Dyer dancing around with his son on his back. Doing the same procedure while pressing up on the joystick shows the game's development team. There are video clips of production footage and interviews on the disc.
The game had a development budget of $2 million

ARCADE DESIGN
Sega billed Time Traveler as ""the World's First 3-D Holographic Video Game"". The game uses a special arcade cabinet that projects the game's characters using reflection, making them appear free-standing. The ""holographic"" effect is an optical illusion using a large black spherical mirror and a CRT television set. Characters appear to stand in mid-air as tiny images about five inches (12.7 cm) tall.
Time Traveler has a non-standard shape for an upright arcade cabinet. Though the game is played standing up, the cabinet is larger and shorter resembling an oversized cocktail design (50""H x 43""W x 45""D) (127 cm x 109.2 cm x 114.3 cm) weighing 370 lb (170 kg). It doesn't have a monitor but instead uses a flat, dark stage called the ""Micro-theater"", which was invented by engineers Steve Zuloff and Barry Benjamin. The Micro-theater is composed of a big concave mirror that lies underneath the stage. This holographic mirror-like optical device was invented by the Japanese firm Dentsu. Along with it, a 20-inch (50.8 cm) Sony TV sits in front of the mirror. The player controls are located on top of the TV equipment. Several neon colored geometric blocks placed at the back of the stage serves as the only background for the game. It is decorated with white formica all around and with a tall ""SEGA Hologram Time Traveler"" sign on its back. 

DVD RELEASE
In 2001, the game was published by Digital Leisure in PC CD-ROM and standard DVD formats. These home versions have the option to simulate the mirror reflection of the original arcade cabinet through a pair of anaglyph stereoscopic glasses. This adds a whirlpool-like moving background to provide an illusory stereoscopic effect.
As with other Digital Leisure DVD releases, the game's box advertises being ""Playstation 2 [or Xbox] Compatible"" on the cover to attract console owners. Bonus features include interviews with creator Rick Dyer about the making of Time Traveler, as well as some of the actors in the game. It also shows behind the scenes footage from some of the scenes without the special effects."

Releasing the button makes their power balls come back to them; the enemies are killed by having the power balls slam into them. There are also pieces of popcorn which can be picked up around the mazes - and pressing the Popcorn button, Pitt and Patti can throw them at the enemies, and they shall bounce off the walls until they hit one (or evaporate if they have not done so by the end of the stage).

Most of them did not scroll automatically and allowed the player a bit more breathing room hence, but they still pressured players with lots of bullets and aggressive enemies. Most big companies offered at least one top-down on-foot shooter, Sega naturally included. Their best-known contribution to that front in the eighties was Alien Syndrome, their tribute to the Alien series which involves two soldiers destroying frightening xenomorphs on derelict vessels.

• 100 meter dash – running by quickly alternating button presses.
• Long jump – running by alternating button press and correct timing for jump — hold jump button to set angle (42 degrees is optimal).
• Javelin throw – running by alternating button presses and then using action button correct timing for angle (43 degrees is optimal).
• 110 meter hurdles – running by alternating button presses and using action button to time jumps.
• Hammer throw – spinning initiated by pressing a run button once and then correctly timed press of action button to choose angle (45 degrees is optimal).
• High jump – running (speed set by computer) and then action button must be held down to determine angle of jump — once in the air, the run button can be rapidly pressed for additional height.

In each event, there is a qualifying time or level that the player must achieve to advance to the next event. Failing to qualify (in one heat for running events or three attempts in the other events) will reduce the player's number of lives by one. If the player has no lives remaining, the game will end. Players can earn extra lives for every 100,000 points scored.

The game can accommodate up to four players, who compete in pairs for the running events and individually for the others. If there are fewer than four players, the remaining slots are filled by the computer (or player ""CPU""). In all multiplayer heats, however, the relative performances of the players do not affect the game; advancing is based solely on qualifying times. While most multiplayer arcade games have their controls arranged from left to right for the players, this game, which features two sets of controls, has a somewhat different setup. The left set of controls is designated for players 2 and 4, while the right set is for players 1 and 3. This is one of the few classic arcade games where single-player mode is played using the right set of controls rather than the left. If a player completes all six events, they are sent back to the field for another round, with higher qualifying levels; however, the game can be configured to conclude after the final event.

Due to the game's response to rapidly pressing the ""run"" buttons, players of the arcade version resorted to various tricks, such as quickly swiping a coin or ping-pong ball over the buttons or using a metal ruler that was repeatedly struck to create vibrations that would press the buttons. As a result, arcade operators reported high rates of damage to the buttons, leading to modifications in later versions to prevent such actions."

Screenshot of the arcade version.

Every level has two parts:

The first part uses an overhead view. Cars overtaken cause the player's rank to increment by 1 per car. The current rank is shown in the bottom right hand corner of the game screen during each stage.

The second part uses an over the shoulder perspective. The player must try not to crash into the opposite cars while a background relative to the city he's traveling to is shown (i.e.: if the player is reaching Las Vegas, then a few casinos can be seen in the background). Oncoming cars passed do not increase the player's rank.

There are five different stages that the player encounters on their way to the final destination (NY) before the game starts back at stage one as outlined below. These stages alternate from tarmac on stages one, three and five, to unsealed (dirt) roads on stages two and four. On the tarmac stages bonus fuel can be picked up by running over the gas can icon. There is also a ""wheelie"" section which when run over causes the rider's bike to do a wheelstand and gain bonus points. On the dirt road stages both fuel and points can be gained by running over the gas cans or the score amounts indicated on the playfield. On the dirt road stage there are several log bridges that cross water and a ""jump"" section on some bridges - riding over the jump icon results in a score bonus. On all stages there are puddles of water which, if ridden through, render the bike unable to steer for a short period of time and a tire squealing sound is played briefly.

Crashing into cars, road edges, bushes/trees, rocks or missing a bridge and riding into the water on a dirt road stage results in the motorcycle stopping and restarting; costing the player an amount of fuel. Running out of fuel prevents the motorcycle from restarting and causes the game to be over; but in the arcade version, the player can continue by inserting more coins (if necessary) and pressing START[a]. Crashing can also result (especially in later levels) in being overtaken by cars which decreases the player's rank.

As the player reaches each city the rank achieved results in a bonus amount being added to the score and extra fuel added to the player's total. The higher the position achieved, the more points and fuel is awarded.

When the player reaches NY, a sign saying ""Viva NY"" will be shown while the Statue of Liberty waves its hand and the Star Spangled Banner is played. After this cut-scene, the game restarts with the player's score intact but the difficulty increases and the player has a higher capacity motorcycle (with correspondingly faster top speed)."

"Tron","","NTSC-U","United States of America","Bally Mfg. Corp. | 																Midway Manufacturing","Bally Midway Mfg.","1982-08-09","2","No","Action","E - Everyone","Tron is a 1982 arcade video game developed and released by Bally Midway in the USA on August 9, 1982.

It is based on the movie, Tron, which was produced by Walt Disney Productions and released in theaters on July 9, 1982.

Tron consists of four sub-games based on events and characters in the movie. In general, the player controls Tron, either in human form or piloting a vehicle, using an eight-way joystick for movement, a trigger button on the stick to fire (or slow down the player's light cycle), and a rotary dial for aiming. The goal of the game is to score points and advance through the game's twelve levels by completing each of the sub-games. Most of the 12 levels are named after programming languages: RPG, COBOL, BASIC, FORTRAN, SNOBOL, PL1, PASCAL, ALGOL, ASSEMBLY, OS, JCL, USER. The game supports two players alternating.

At the start of each level, the player is taken to a ""Game Grid"" selection screen divided into four quadrants. The player must choose a quadrant, each of which corresponds to a different sub-game. The sub-game in each quadrant is not known to the player until it is selected. If the player fails the game and loses a life, they are taken back to this selection screen and an icon representing that game is now visible. Failure to choose a quadrant before an on-screen timer runs out results in a sub-game being chosen at random. Once the player completes a particular sub-game, it is taken out of play until the start of the next level.

The sub-games are as follows:

I/O Tower
The player must guide Tron to the flashing circle of an Input/Output Tower within a set time limit while avoiding or destroying Grid Bugs. This game is based on the I/O Tower scene in the film, while adding the Grid Bugs as enemies (which were only briefly mentioned in the film). A bit occasionally appears on the screen and can be picked up for bonus points.

MCP Cone
The player must break through a rotating shield wall protecting the MCP cone and enter the cone without touching any of the shield blocks. This game is based on Tron's final battle with the MCP in the film, but changes the nature of the MCP's shield. Bonus points are awarded for destroying every block in the shield.

Light Cycles
In a player-vs-AI variant of the Snake game concept, the player guides Tron's blue Light Cycle in an arena against one or more yellow opponents. The objective is to force the enemy cycles to crash into walls, jet trails, or each other, while simultaneously avoiding them. When an enemy cycle crashes, both it and its trail disappear. This game is based on the Light Cycle Arena sequence in the film, though the colors of the friendly and enemy characters are reversed. This is the only sub-game in Tron to not use the rotary dial.

Battle Tanks
The player must guide Tron's red battle tank through a maze and destroy all of the opposing blue enemy tanks by shooting each of them three times. The tank can warp to a random location in the maze by moving into a diamond in the center, and its shots bounce off walls or obstructions until reaching their maximum travel distance. In higher difficulty levels, the enemy tanks are replaced by red Recognizers that are much faster and attempt to collide with the player instead of shooting at him/her. This game is not based on any particular scene, but is rather based on Tank Program elements, including Clu's failed intrusion into the ENCOM mainframe and the ""Space Paranoids"" game featured at the beginning of the film."

The acceleration button needs to be held down all the time while the 'trick' button makes the water-skiing girl spin through one-eighty degrees and proceed to ski backwards. The player cannot steer while traveling backwards, but will earn bonus points for the duration of the trick. As the game progresses, small ramps, buoys and sharks come into play. The small ramps can be jumped to add to the player's score, although they're always in difficult to reach locations. The buoys are usually very close together, but skiing between them earns bonus points. Finally, the shark will appear from time-to-time, running into it means game over, regardless of how much time the player has left."

"Turbo Force","","Region Not Set","","Video System Co., Ltd.","Video System Co., Ltd.","1991-04-01","3","No","Shooter","","Turbo Force is even more of a direct predecessor to Sonic Wings than is Rabio Lepus: Turbo Force features vertical scrolling gameplay very similar to that of the Sonic Wings series along with a nearly identical power-up system. (The only differences in power-ups are that the vehicle slowly loses power even if not damaged, and that instead of a bomb that can be deployed at the player's discretion, the special weapon detonates as soon as its power-up is touched.)

Still, Turbo Force lacks Sonic Wings' in-game, backstory, dialogue, and well-developed characters, although the developers did conceive of a plot to explain some of what happens in the game. According to the graphic designer Soukou Junyoukan (装甲巡洋艦, aka ""Armored Cruiser""), ""The story is that an American Air Force pilot, while racing his car on a public road, wanders into another mysterious dimension and gets caught up in a war there. Oops!""[1] This other dimension takes the pilot (and two of his buddies, if all three players are used) into a future world which has been invaded by an alien civilization. The pilot modifies his car into a flying, fighting machine and sets out to defend the new world from its enemies.[2]

Soukou-san explains that Turbo Force's developers basically did whatever they wanted in designing the game, resulting in a somewhat mismatched feel. The developers used what they learned from creating Turbo Force to make Sonic Wings a better, and more successful, game."

"Two Tigers","","Region Not Set","","Bally Mfg. Corp.","Bally | 																Midway","1984-10-01","2","No","Shooter","","Two Tigers is an arcade game created by Bally Midway and released in 1984. It is themed around World War II-era planes attempting to sink military ships, but there are no references as to which countries are involved in the conflict.

Two Tigers offers the choice of two separate modes: one or two players working together to sink large enemy ships, or a dogfight mode where two players attempt to down each other's plane.

The game was not ported to home computers or game consoles.

In the primary mode, each player steers his or her always moving plane by rotating it clockwise and counter-clockwise. Enemy planes fly horizontally across the screen; shooting them causes them to crash into the warship along the bottom. Each crash damages the ship. Mines floating in the water can be shot, damaging the ship from below. Players can damage the ship directly by dropping bombs. Only one bomb per player can be in the air at once.

Repeated damage to the same location causes a leak. When enough leaks have been created (based on the level), the ship explodes. As an intermission, submarines, sharks, and swimmers occupy the open water and can be shot. After a brief respite, a new ship arrives.

Lives are unlimited in Two Tigers. Flying into another plane spawns a replacement once the wreckage falls offscreen. Player-controlled planes are unable to collide with the ship at the bottom. After a certain amount of time an undestroyed ship leaves—another such departure ends the game."

If the player's car hits another car or object while in LOW gear, the car will spin out but not explode.

During the race players will pass through a number of different environments, including tunnels, snow-covered landscape and meadows. Controls consist of steering, shift, accelerator, and brake. The right screen displays the number of cars passed, using one star to represent each passed car. The left screen displays the checkpoint map, the high score and the player's score.

This is an isometric scrolling game where the player controls a jester & has to either walk on or shoot tiles to change them from black to purple. The player can also walk over holes to change them to black tiles, which then can be changed to purple by doing either of those 2 things. Sometimes, a crown will appear. By walking over the crown, the level automatically ends and the player is transported a few levels beyond the last one. There are several enemies including various soldiers, knights, elephants, ostrich like birds, archers, and royal characters like princes, queens, and kings that the player can shoot to temporarily defeat. There is also a flat block that can only be defeated by shooting at its narrow side (not directly from the front or behind). There are also flashing tiles that the player has to get to prevent the cracking of the tiles. Once the player steps on or shoots these, he is temporarily invincible until the screen stops flashing.

He has dreams of becoming an airline pilot for his fiance's father's airline corporation, but one night in Paris, his backstabbing friend Kanzaki takes him to a bar and has him get drunk enough to trick him into joining the Asran military, where he must serve for 3 years.

He can desert, which is considered a federal crime in Asran. In the fight against Project 4, Shin is joined by two pilots, Mickey Simon and Greg Gates.

The player can choose between three mercenary pilots: Shin Kazama, Mickey Simon, and Greg Gates. Each pilot flies a specific plane and has slightly different capabilities.

Shin Kazama: Shin flies an F-20 Tigershark; the weapons on his plane fire forward only but at a quick pace. Shin and his plane are the most balanced combination available.
Mickey Simon: Mickey flies an F-14 Tomcat; the weapons on his plane also fire forward only, but are also larger (albeit slower), inflicting more damage than Shins plane.

Unlike many other Shoot Em Ups of its time, the game has you pilot a Humongous Mecha that fires out Rocket Punches for its weapon. Along the way, you can also pick up a gun for your mecha, and eventually, larger modules that boost your firepower even further. Taking damage will downgrade your mecha's form (or lose its upgrade module if it has one) to a standard ship, which will be destroyed on the next hit, although you can upgrade your ship back up to mecha form (it takes one powerup to upgrade to a larger, slightly more powerful ship, and one more to upgrade back to mecha form).

If you are in upgraded ship form or higher, you can split your mecha/ship up (up to 3 times, unless you get an upgrade) into separate parts. In ship or mecha form, this reduces your hitbox and turns your non-main parts into Attack Drones. In upgraded mecha form, this grants an alternate fire form.

Dangar is a pretty neat shooter, especially for its time, if you can get past some of its quirks as an 80's shooter (Checkpoints instead of respawning where you died, the fact that you need to stay alive long enough to get the upgrades, lack of bullets in contrast to more modern shmups)."

Based around a video game within a video game concept, players assume the role of a young secret agent assigned by the government taking control of the NA-00 space fighter craft in an attempt to defeat the titular virtual reality simulator, rescue the abducted players who lost against it and unveil its true purpose.

Headed by DonPachi producer Kenichi Takano, Grind Stormer was created by a small development team of new employees at Toaplan who would later go on to work at one of its offshoots after the company declared bankruptcy in 1994 and was originally titled Bakuretsu Wing before being ultimately renamed to V・V in Japan. It is notable for marking the debut of Cave co-founder Tsuneki Ikeda in the video game industry, serving as one of its programmers and features a much smaller hitbox for the ship compared with previous shoot 'em up games released at the time. It is also notable for being one of the last games by Toaplan to feature an FM soundtrack, as the company began to clear out their FM chip inventory. Initially launched for the arcades, the game was later ported to the Sega Genesis by Tengen and first published in Japan on 25 March 1994 and a month later in North America, featuring both the original Japanese and North American versions as selectable gameplay modes.

Grind Stormer proved to be popular in arcades but the game has been met with mixed reception from critics and reviewers alike since its release on the Genesis, who felt divided in regards to several aspects such as the presentation, visuals, sound design and gameplay. It has been regarded by some to be an early example of a manic shooter. As of 2019, its rights are owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in 2017 by former Toaplan member Masahiro Yuge and now-affiliate of Japanese arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia alongside many other Toaplan IPs."

Van-Van Car was licensed to Karateco in Europe for manufacture and distribution; as with Dream Shopper and Dr. Micro, it runs on Namco's Pac-Man hardware (a Zilog Z80, running at 3.072 MHz), but with two Texas Instruments SN76496 sound chips running at 1.78975 MHz for sound. The flyer may give the impression that it uses an isometric perspective but it uses the same overhead view as the first six Pac-Man titles - and, the player must use a 4-directional joystick to take control of a yellow racer car (the eponymous ""Van-Van Car""), which is on a mission to burst balloons with its front-mounted spike while watching out for the three ""killer"" cars (which are red, green, and blue, so the last one looks somewhat like an evil version of the car from Namco's Rally-X).

Each normal balloon burst will be worth 200 points, regardless of color; also, if you press that ""Jump Button"", Van-Van Car will jump into the air, and every time it jumps over one of the killer cars, you will receive 100 points. However, if Van-Van Car should land on one of the killer cars, it will (ironically) be killed just as if it had crashed into one - and when there are only eight balloons left, a ""bonus"" balloon will appear in that maze. Once you burst it, you will receive 500 points for every regular balloon left in that maze (so the maximum amount of points you can receive for doing so is 4000); also, if you burst an ""energy"" (yellow) balloon, Van-Van Car will gain a missile. Once you press the Jump Button while in possession of it, Van-Van Car will fire it - and it will destroy any balloons (and killer cars) it ploughs through, for 200 and 1000 points respectively. It is also not advisable to burst another energy balloon until you have fired the missile as Van-Van Car can only hold one at a time, and the killer cars cannot pass over the balloons and will be forced to go around them; the killer cars will also not chase directly after Van-Van Car immediately and will only do so after a preset number of balloons have been burst or a preset amount of time has passed. Finally, Van-Van Car will start spinning around in a clockwise direction at twice its normal speed when it passes over an oil slick - and even though it loses its jump power, it will quickly be able to get away from the killer cars, especially when they are close behind it."

Vanguard is similar to Scramble, in that the player controls a ship which automatically flies forward through scrolling levels. It has a limited amount of fuel that constantly depletes. Unlike Scramble, fuel is replenished by destroying enemies, so running out of fuel is less common. Some portions of Vanguard scroll vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

The ship can fire lasers independently in any of the four cardinal directions using the four buttons. Flying into an energy pod makes the ship invulnerable for a short while, allowing both enemy ships and the tunnel walls to be destroyed by ramming.

The game is divided into two tunnels of multiple zones each. The first tunnel consists of Mountain Zone, Rainbow Zone, Styx Zone, Rainbow Zone 2, Stripe Zone, Rainbow Zone 3, Bleak Zone, and the City of Mystery/Last Zone. The second tunnel consists of Mountain Zone, Stripe Zone, Styx Zone, Rainbow Zone, Bleak Zone, and the City of Mystery/Last Zone. At the end of each tunnel the player must defeat a boss guarded by two moving force fields with holes in them.

Vanguard uses a number of custom sound chips to produce digitized voices and custom synthesizer sounds. The speech is used to announce the name of the current zone or the next zone that is about to be entered, or the words ""be careful"" when a power-up is about to end. Theme music composed by Jerry Goldsmith for the 1979 sci-fi film Star Trek: The Motion Picture, later utilized for Star Trek: The Next Generation, is borrowed as Vanguard's introductory theme. Vultan's theme (composed by Queen's Freddie Mercury) from the 1980 movie Flash Gordon is used as the sound effect when a power-up is attained."

"Vapor Trail","","Region Not Set","","Data East Corporation","Data East Corporation","1989-01-01","2","Yes","Shooter","","The game features 2 players controlling the jet fighters simultaneously for battle across numerous levels. There are 3 types of jets varying from different classes of speeds and firepower. The Silph is the midrange plane with the most balance. While the Valkyrie carries the most firepower, and the Seylen jet is capable of flying at the highest mach speed. Weapon upgrades are available throughout the game, ranging from homing missiles, ring guns, flame throwers and many more. Each jet may also activate the shield manually in times of trouble.
Weapons

Players have a choice between four different standard pick-up weapons: Vulcan – the player's default weapon which fires straight forward, but can flare out to destroy larger groups of enemies depending on the jet selected. Bombs – a straight firing, explosive weapon that retains the same firing pattern for all jets, but increases in launch count (number of times it can be fired at once) when upgraded. Defender – an explosive cluster-shot weapon that encircles the player's jet and remains the same when upgraded, but increases in count much like the Bombs. Missiles – homing missiles that fire from multiple directions of the jet. Similar to the Vulcan, the Missiles fire in different directions depending on the jet that is used.

Every jet is equipped with a roll device that allows them to kamikaze safely into other jets. The roll must be re-charged after every use. Players also have the choice to pick up the S-Unit, a weapon attachment that empowers the jet's firing no matter what weapon is picked-up previously and every jet's S-Unit attack differs from the others. Once the S-Unit is equipped, the player cannot use their previous weapons unless the S-Unit is detonated. Detonating the S-Unit does not harm the player, but it does harm the enemy as the unit will detonate in a large and powerful explosion."

"Venture","","Region Not Set","","Exidy, Inc.","Exidy, Inc.","1981-06-01","","No","Adventure","","The goal of Venture is to collect treasure from a dungeon. Winky is equipped with a bow and arrow and explores a dungeon with rooms and hallways. The hallways are patrolled by large, tentacled monsters named Hallmonsters, which cannot be killed, injured, or stopped in any way. Once in a room, Winky may kill monsters, avoid traps and gather treasures. If they stay in any room too long, a Hallmonster will enter the room, chase and kill them. In this way, the Hallmonsters serve the same role as ""Evil Otto"" in the arcade game Berzerk. The more quickly the player finishes each level, the higher their score.

The goal of each room is only to steal the room's treasure. In most rooms, it is possible (though difficult) to steal the treasure without defeating the monsters within. Some rooms have traps that are only sprung when the player picks up the treasure. For instance, in ""The Two-Headed Room"", two 2-headed ettins appear the moment the player picks up the prize.

Winky dies if he touches a monster or Hallmonster. Dead monsters decay over time and their corpses may block room exits, delaying Winky and possibly allowing the Hallmonster to enter. Shooting a corpse causes it to regress back to its initial death phase. The monsters themselves move in specific patterns but may deviate to chase the player, and the game's AI allows them to dodge the player's shots with varying degrees of ""intelligence"" (for example, the snakes of ""The Serpent Room"" are relatively slow to dodge arrows, the trolls of ""The Troll Room"" are quite adept at evasion).

The game consists of three different dungeon levels with different rooms. After clearing all the rooms in a level the player advances to the next. After three levels the room pattern and monsters repeat, but at a higher speed and with a different set of treasures.

The different dungeons in each level are as follows:

    Level 1 - The Wall Room, The Serpent Room, The Skeleton Room, The Goblin Room
    Level 2 - The Two-Headed Room, The Dragon Room, The Spider Room, The Troll Room
    Level 3 - The Genie Room, The Demon Room, The Cyclops Room, The Bat Room

"Vimana","","Region Not Set","","Toaplan Co., Ltd.","Toaplan Co., Ltd.","1991-01-01","2","Yes","Shooter","","Vimana is one of Toaplan's most unique shooters. The level design is particularly creative, along with a unique charge shot and bombs. It gets its name from the Sanskrit word for ""Flying Machine"", described in Sanskrit Epics. The storyline involves a planet being attacked by seemingly indestructible alien forces that induce fear and insanity to all that oppose them. The last hope for this planet is the Vimana Warriors, two ships that are empowered by the Hindu god Ganesha to defend against the aliens and restore peace to the galaxy.

The Vimana warriors are the player one and player two ships, each equipped with a shot that charges in the shape of a V. Once the shot is released, the V shape explodes forth in an arc, hitting almost everything in front of it. This sounds like it would be a very powerful weapon, but this leads to Vimana's main problem - none of your attacks ever do enough damage. Even the weakest enemies will take more than a few hits to destroy, even if your weapon is fully powered up. Bombs are similarly underwhelming, consisting of seven balls of light that rotate around your ship and guard you from shots. Once an enemy comes onto screen, a light ball will jump out from the group and crash into the enemy, likely destroying or heavily damaging it. Unlike in Fire Shark, where you can pick up new weapons, Vimana does not offer any weapons other than standard shots, charge shots, and bombs.

Vimana has some bits of creativity in its levels. One in particular has moving enemy searchlights, which will fire hard to dodge bullets if it spots you. An interesting boss fires from the bottom of the screen as opposed to the top. Vimana also attempts to squeeze around 50 enemy bullets on screen at once, making it feel like a sort of prototype bullet hell shooter.

Vimana was never ported to any home systems, but like Out Zone it would not have really fit onto any of them very well. The music was done by Toshiaki Tomizawa, who would later go on to make soundtracks for Fixeight, another Toaplan shooter and many of Cave's games, including Dodonpachi, Progear, Guwange, and ESP Ra.

"Vindicators","","Region Not Set","","Atari Games","Atari Games","1988-01-01","2","Yes","Action","Not Rated","he game begins by asking the player(s) to choose a difficulty level, not only making the enemies more difficult and the players weaker, but higher difficulties start the players in a later set of levels (called ""galaxies"") and with some powerups. The easiest difficulty level starts the player(s) in the first level with no bonuses. The player controls a tank with constantly draining fuel, and must navigate through multiple levels (14 stations in the arcade version) from bottom to top, encountering obstacles and enemies. Along the way, a player may find powerups including tank fuel, stars (currency), shields, and two types of sub-weapons: smart shots (homing missiles) and bombs (powerful rockets). Each level has a key that will open a door at the top of the level, which will either take the player to the next level or to a special hub with multiple powerups that must be escaped in 10 seconds or less.  If the player is unable to escape, the tank will lose half its fuel. After escaping the hub, the player(s) then proceeds to the next station.

Occasionally, the player(s) will face a boss that must be defeated to advance. Normal shots are ineffective however, and the player must decide/guess the appropriate time to buy sub-weapons to greatly raise the chance of victory. After destroying a boss, the player(s) can continue to the end of the level.

Between levels, the player is taken to a shop where items and upgrades to tank speed, power, etc. may be purchased with stars. Any damage caused to the player's tank will decrease the shield level. Purchasing a shield drastically reduces damage down to a mere pixel worth of the fuel gauge per hit. When the fuel depletes, the speed of the tank is reduced to a crawl and a countdown begins from 10. If no fuel is gained before the timer reaches zero, or if the player is shot during the countdown, the tank explodes and a life is lost.

The arcade version, in addition to having special two-joystick controls for each player, contained three special contest levels, with one contest star in each. With three contest stars and nine normal stars, the player(s) could compete in a special time-limited contest level in which the player could win a T-shirt.

The arena size could be adjusted up to a very small platform or all the way to 82 meters, which in the genre is considered very large; this is the only game in the series—other than Virtua Fighter Remix—that could have such size adjustments. The physical energy meter could also be adjusted to infinity as well, giving you the advantage when beating opponents in the game or practicing moves against the computer player. Incidentally, players discovered that adjusting the arena to a smaller size and giving the characters infinite health could lead to mock sumo matches, wherein victory is achieved by knocking the other player out of the ring."

The shield option adds more durability, but only for the front of the Vic Viper, while the forcefield adds protection for the entire spacecraft, albeit only against three hits.

"Wonder Momo","","Region Not Set","","Namco","Namco","1987-02-01","","No","Action | Platform","","Wonder Momo is a loose parody of a typical Ultraman-style superhero series, and utilizing a then-rare female protagonist. When the game is first started, players are treated to a parody of the MGM logo featuring Momo instead of a lion and a ""Modoki"" instead of a mask. The game then cuts to a scene of a theater stage, where a play begins starring Momo, a young woman who gets super-powers. At this point the game puts the player in command of Momo. Rather than playing a hero who needs to save the world, the setting is that of a live stage show (set at the ""Namco Theater""), and the player is actually controlling an actress who is merely playing the role of Momo/Wonder Momo. The game also features voice samples in Japanese.

As Momo, she can only attack using kicks, and in doing so builds up her ""Wonder"" meter. When she touches a tornado icon, or spins around by herself, she can turn into Wonder Momo and can also attack using the Wonder Hoop, which can be reused as long as she is Wonder Momo. After the Wonder Hoop is thrown, she won't be able to throw anymore, while she'll have to wait for it to bounce back to her. She can also shoot small waves of energy in whichever direction she faces (while she is crouching), which is based on the similar move by the Ultraman characters. Her most powerful attack is the Wonder Typhoon - a more powerful version of her small energy wave attack which shoots numerous amounts of small energy waves towards the left and right sides of the screen simultaneously, while she is spinning.

The game is notable for featuring some slightly risqué content for the time, in the form of fanservice (at Momo's expense). When Momo jumps, the player can visibly see her underwear. Momo also needs to be wary of photographers in the theatre audience, who are determined to get a peek under her miniskirt. If one is successful, Momo will get ""embarrassed"" (stunned) for a short period of time. Additionally, one of the images that appears on the theater curtain (at the beginning and end of some acts) is Momo wearing only a towel."

At the start of the game the players must select either ""singles"" (Player 1 v Player 2) or ""doubles"" (Player Team v CPU Team); they must then select one of twenty different players (ten male, eight female and two robot) before selecting one of three different courts (New York hard, London lawn, and Paris clay). They must then select whether they want the match to be one or three sets long - and, once they have done so, their two (or four) chosen players will come out, and take their positions on the court. The players must use an eight-way joystick to direct their chosen players around their half of the court and two buttons to hit the ball with their rackets; but just like in a real tennis match, faults, net balls and deuce can occur (but the ""Deuce"" setting in the options menu can be turned off)."

The cabinet also plays Galaga, and the machine can be set to play either of them or only one of them; however, Galaga does not seem to be enhanced in any way. 

Gameplay
Gameplay is identical to the classic with some additions:

    A second player is able to play simultaneously, similarly to the 1996 version of Pac-Man Arrangement. The second player even plays as a Green Pac-Man.
    The maze cycles through colors throughout gameplay.
    When 2 players play together, a light colored string will connect to the 2 Pac-Men to the bottom left and right corners to help remind players who's playing as who.
    A high score table is shown for every maze level, not just after getting a game over.
    The screen is enormous, made entirely of LED lights.
    Companies and businesses can upload photos into the machine for them to be advertised during Attract mode.
    Both games have continue screens, where the player can pay for an extra game and continue where they got a game over at.
    Instead of spawning at the center of the maze, Fruit will hop around the maze like it did in Ms. Pac-Man. The fruit will also cycle through different fruits, each one being a different point value.
    At the end of a maze, point are totaled up between players, and whoever got the most points is labeled the winner. This is nearly identical to Pac-Man Arrangement '96's multiplayer score screen.

The player controls a flying attack craft, the Solvalou, to destroy the Xevious forces plotting to take over Earth. The Solvalou has two weapons: a zapper that fires projectiles at flying enemies and a blaster for bombing ground installations and vehicles. A reticle in front of the ship shows where bombs will land.

The game has a total of 16 connected areas, which loop back to the first after completing them all. Dying about 70% through starts the player at the beginning of the next. Areas are geographically distinct, with features such as forests, roads, rivers, and mechanical structures. Certain areas have Nazca lines placed on the ground, some in the ""condor"" design.

The game becomes progressively more difficult as the player becomes more skilled. Once the player does well at destroying a certain enemy type, a more advanced enemy type replaces it. Destroying flashing-red ""Zolback"" radars found on the ground will cause the game to switch back to easier enemies.

Certain points in the game have a fight against the Andor Genesis mothership, which launch an endless stream of projectiles and explosive black spheres known as ""Zakatos"". The player can either destroy all four blaster receptacles or the core in the center to defeat it. Some parts of the game have hidden towers (""Sol Citadels""), which can be found by bombing specific parts of an area. The Solvalou's bomb reticle flashes red when over one.

At the end of each level, players can enter a shop where supplies and power-ups can be purchased with any coins they have collected. Some supplies, such as 'Shield' or 'Speed' are permanent, whereas others are only temporary and must be replenished.

A map of each level is displayed at the top of the screen. For some levels, all enemies, objects and walls are shown. On later levels, however, the map may only display the enemy robots and/or objects; with the maze walls and layout only becoming visible once a player has 'looked' at a wall section. Xybots' gameplay feels highly reminiscent of a 3-Dimensional ""Gauntlet"" (with good reason, see TRIVIA for more details). The game also uses a split-screen display to allow for two-player simultaneous play; something of an innovation for 1987.

Like the ""Gauntlet"" games on which Xybots is based; the game is endless and play will continue until all lives are lost and players no longer wish to use the 'Continue' option."

Story

In the near future, an Asian conglomerate known as Igem develops a unique energy source capable of developing a number of innovative machines. Their over-abundant research with the energy leads to the construction of a weather control machine called ONI, developed entirely for the purpose of taking over the world. Once ONI is activated, the countries of the world suffer and Igem's secret militia move in to destroy any opposition. It is here that the Zero Gunner squadron is called into action to stop Igem and to destroy ONI.

Gameplay
One or two players can take their pick of three helicopters, each with their own firing pattern and battle oncoming waves of enemies through 7 different stages, each with a boss at the end. Each boss has a different form at the beginning, such as a train, boat, airplane, or submarine, but after the players have inflicted enough damage, it turns into a giant robot. After the players destroy the robot, the stage ends and they progress on to the new stage. There are 9 modes of difficulty, ranging from ""Child"", where enemies fire little to none when fired upon to ""Very Hard"", where enemies fire at almost any given moment.
The game is particularly innovative by including a way to rotate the helicopter in 360 degrees, allowing the player to fire in any direction. Most of the time this is required to survive, as enemies not only come from the top of the screen, but the left, right, and bottom as well. Like other scrolling shooters, the game makes use of power-ups to improve a helicopter's firepower. Each player also has a ""Special"" Bar, which slowly rises whenever players collect the little ""E"" icons from destroyed enemies. Every time the bar fills, the player has an opportunity to unleash their helicopter's special attack which often is capable of destroying every enemy on the screen. The first 4 stages, either Alpine Armored Train, Submergence City, Sea of Cloud, or Marine Base, are chosen in random order. The last 3 stages, Asian Slum, Orbital Elevator, and Aerial Capital, are in a set order. Helicopters are:
• the Comanche, which is blue and has lasers as its main weapon.
• the Apache, which is dark green and has blue bullets and straight-firing missiles as its weaponry.
• the Hokum, which is yellow and is the best helicopter, considering it has guided missiles, bullets that deal high damage, and a Special Attack that is 99 rounds and includes small planes that fire at the enemy and follow you around."

The stages themselves all seem to be themed around different parts of the world: The kabuki boss on the far-left represents Japan, the chef represents China and mainland Asia, the crusader knight stands for Europe, and the superhero on the far-right stands for America. Yet even outside of the Japanese stages, there's a distinctly goofy flair about the game that emphasizes screwy cultural stereotypes from a Japanese game company. The game's actual developer, Minato Giken, also helped work on the Game Gear version of Dynamite Headdy, one of the most fantastically insane Genesis platformers ever, and that same sort of unhinged design can also be seen in ZnY.

It was shipped to the USA on December 1, 2004.

The 19-in-1 is the fourth and final release of the original X-in-1 family of bootleg arcade PCBs. Unlike the 39-in-1, 48-in-1, and 60-in-1, which used a vertical screen orientation, the 19-in-1 used a horizontal screen orientation. All games are unofficially licensed by the original copyright holders of the games, despite the fact that these boards were still sold anyways due to being cheap to produce.

To avoid any issues with copyright in the USA, they removed all copyright holder names from the roms, the only thing left is the release year of the game, some games appear as ""1 9 8 0"", instead of the original spacing. This does not work however since it is still copyright infringement as these boards are sold illegally and some use them to earn money.

When enabled in the test menu, the song, Exluna, will play on the menu. This song was also used on the later version of the 48-in-1 and on the 60-in-1.
