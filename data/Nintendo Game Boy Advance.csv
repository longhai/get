The main game mode is V-Rally Mode. It takes players through a rally championship over seven different countries, with each country's course consisting of distinct stages. Stages are taken on in groups of two, allowing for changing of car setup and repairs after every pair. Car setup options include a choice of tires (appropriate to road and weather conditions) as well as suspension, steering, brakes and gearbox. Bumping into the roadside during a race damages the car, with body, suspension, brakes, steering and turbos getting individual damage ratings. The repairs must be possible to be carried out within a time window or there is no choice but to drive on with the damage. The game's second major mode is called V-Rally Cross and offers traditional circuit racing on five different tracks. Only one is available from the start, the others have to be unlocked by winning on the earlier tracks. Races are against three opponents and consist of two rounds of three laps each, one in forward, one in reverse direction. Performing well in the first round fills a boost meter that can be utilized in the second. Time Trial mode allows single runs utilizing cars and tracks unlocked in the other modes. Multiplayer is available via the link cable and offers two-player versions of V-Rally Cross and Time Trial. You play a stuntman who has the task of completing some difficult and challenging stunts for a film director. Get it right and he'll ask you on for another project, and pay you big time. Get it wrong, and it's time for a career change. Apart from the Movie Making mode, Precision Tests will have you completing courses of varying difficulty, where you'll have to drive forward and reverse, launch off of jumps, dodge through posts and then park inside a zone before time runs out. In Jump Tests, you'll be out to grab letters while jumping off of platforms to catch them while airborne.

Size-optimized ports of Artemio's 240p Test Suite to 8-bit consoles

    Nintendo Entertainment System
    Game Boy and Game Boy Color (as ""144p Test Suite"")
    Game Boy Advance (as ""160p Test Suite"")

The NES and GB ports are in assembly language for speed and size efficiency. The GBA port is in C, but still size-optimized to fit well within the 256 KiB multiboot limit.

The GB and GBA ports have a different name because their LCD video timing doesn't match that of NTSC. They exist to test not only the TV but also the Super Game Boy or Game Boy Player accessory, which behaves as a scaler.

Some functionality has been rearranged to fit the controller or to combine the function of similar tests. Some help pages have been rewritten for completeness, conciseness, and English usage improvements. Some tests' graphics have been replaced to keep the software free.

To get set up to build the NES port, install GNU Make, Coreutils, Python 3, Pillow, and cc65 per nrom-template instructions. The port to Game Boy uses RGBDS instead of cc65. The GBA port uses devkitARM and libgba by devkitPro, but Python 3 and Pillow are still required to convert the proportional font.

Like Artemio's original versions, these ports of 240p Test Suite are free software under the GNU General Public License, version 2 or later.

This is the largest known GBA multi-cart to date, which the packaging also boasts by putting its size (2048M) on the label.

The Game Boy Advance titles included were chosen mainly by popularity. Some titles include Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga, Mario Kart: Super Circuit, and all four Super Mario Advance games. The NES games were seemingly picked at random from GoodNES, a complete set of every NES game currently dumped and available on the internet. The games are in random sections, but the sections themselves have the games in the exact order of GoodNES. The names of the games, however, have been altered to what seem to be mistranslated, presumably from a Chinese version of the cart. Popular titles like the original Super Mario Bros. are missing due to this bizarre strategy. This also means inappropriate hacks and sometimes flat-out broken games are included in the compilation. Some noteworthy titles include:

    Super Contra 8 (both Super Contra 8 and Super Contra 7 are included, despite being the exact same game).

    Harry Story (bootleg Wacky Races hack; also listed as Harry potter a).

    Kart Fighter (listed as Star big fights and The game Stars the big).

    MegaFag (debatably the most offensive of the inappropriate hacks; listed as Rockman 6, the original title of the unhacked game).

    MegaCrap (another offensive/inappropriate hack; listed as Rockman 5, also the original title of the unhacked game).
    Druggy Final Fight (offensive/inappropriate hack of Mighty Final Fight; listed as The final combat).

You are the werewolf of the title and you decide to enter Dracula's castle to ask him to stop his reign of terror.. Dracula's not happy to have visitors so you got plenty of his fellows that will try to stop you. Reach the Dracula's room to achieve victory!

Your werewolf has the ability to walk any wall or roof. He can punch, dash and jump.

Punch or dash your enemies right in head to kill them.
Use defense to daze your opponent in case of direct attack or to reflect them the bullets they throw you.
When you jump, you go directly to the wall opposite to the one you stand.
Landing on spikes will hurt you and throw you back at the start point of your jump.

Your jump works also as attack and defense together: it reflects bullets and kills enemies. It's the most effective and rapid weapon to collect chain score.

There are three gauges on the osd:

Red - Indicates your health.
Blue - The chain meter.
Green - The magic meter.
The green one is charged by green gems you obtain killing enemies. Once the gauge is full, if you have acquired powerups during games, you'll be able to use them.

Once your green meter is full, the enemies will drop golden ingots, which size depends on your blue chain meter counter. Bigger ingot bigger points value.

Any time you kill an enemy the blue gauge replenishes and starts a rapid depleting. To rise up your chain counter you have to defeat an enemy before the chain gauge goes down to 0."

cursor. It defaults to 3 seconds, but for the most

It is an innovative title that has the player consolidating a multitude of planets together in each stage to create on large rock. It was remade on WiiWare under the title of Art Style: ORBIENT, and was the first of at least three titles to be released in the Art Style series.

Gameplay
Before starting a stage the player will have to choose which galaxy he or she wishes to play within and then the stage. Following this your small star will shoot towards a large body with a varying amount of small stars orbiting it. The goal is to come in possession of those other stars in order to increase the size of the primary one. When ready, the player will shoot out of the orbit of a star and then be pulled into another one when he enters its range. If the player touches the star that the smaller ones are revolving around, then your star will blow up. With this said, it's suggested you constantly adjust the speed of your stara as not to rush into an orbit, ultimately causing it to crash.

When one wishes to enter the orbit of a star, he'll have to press the A button, which is will ""attract"" your star towards it. If you don't want to enter it, then you'll have to press B, which will repel it. If the player wishes to change the position of the camera, then they can use the d-pad.

When not in orbit around a star, you'll simply be floating. This is when you have to use a combination of the attract and repel buttons in order to change your direction. If you're going near a large star, then its orbit will effect the player more than a smaller one would, and you have more of a chance to start revolving around it.

There are multiple obstacles in the game that are represented by the color red. Basically if it's red, you want to stay away from it. unfortunately using the repel or attract button will have no effect when you're next to an obstacle, though if a star is nearby and you're heading straight towards an obstacle, it's suggested that you get out of its way. Sometimes these hazards will even revolve around stars."

""Demon Castle Dracula: Circle of the Moon""), and simply as Castlevania in Europe, is an action-adventure platform game released for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance in 2001. The game was the first Castlevania game for the system. It was the last game in the franchise to bear the classic ""Akumajō Dracula"" title in Japan until Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow was released. Subsequent entries also adopted the ""Castlevania"" moniker.

Plot
The year is 1830. At an old Austrian castle, the worshipers of Chaos attempted to revive the Lord of Darkness, Count Dracula. Vampire Hunter Morris Baldwin and his apprentices, Nathan Graves and Hugh Baldwin, heard of this and headed to Castlevania to stop Count Dracula's resurrection and restoration of power. However, they arrived a few seconds too late and Camilla, a minion of Count Dracula, started the rite to revive her master.

In order for Dracula to regain his former power, he would need to wait until the full moon ritual was completed. Before the group could fight Dracula and reseal him, Dracula destroyed the floor under Nathan and Hugh, causing them to plummet down a long shaft, leaving Morris alone with Dracula and Camilla. Fortunately, Nathan and Hugh survived the fall. Hugh ran off to save his father after telling Nathan to leave the castle. Nathan decided not to, as he too wanted to ensure that his master was safe. He then explored the large castle, fighting Dracula's minions along the way.

After fighting Camilla, Nathan learned that Hugh was possessed by Dracula after the vampire exploited his desire to become more powerful than Nathan. He wanted to prove that he was superior to Nathan so Morris would bestow the Hunter Whip to him instead of Nathan. When Nathan defeated him, Hugh came to his senses and leaves to find Morris.

Nathan arrived at the ceremonial room to vanquish Dracula and save his teacher from being sacrificed in the full moon ritual. While he fought Dracula, Hugh freed Morris and together they escaped the castle, leaving Nathan to finish vanquishing Dracula. He succeeds in beating Dracula's ultimate form. Before he was sealed, Dracula stated ""It is a wasted effort. I will never be truly gone. So long as there is darkness and desire in the soul of man, I will continue to be revived"". Nathan replied, ""And we will be there to stop you. You can bet on that"". Dracula dies and the castle crumbles. Nathan then leaves to continue his training with Morris and Hugh.

Note: The storyline from Castlevania: Circle of the Moon has been retroactively removed from the official Castlevania timeline by Koji Igarashi. Many claim it has been reinstated after the release of Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin because it can be found in the timeline that accompanied the pre-order bundle for that game in America; however, the game was still not listed on the official timeline issued by Konami in 2009."

The game was part of the initial batch of bit Generations games. The game was not released in America or Europe, but a remake of the game, titled Art Style: ROTOHEX for the Wii's WiiWare service, was released two years later in 2008. The remake was slightly different, though was instantly recognizable to fans of Dialhex.

Gameplay
In Dialhex, you turn differently colored triangles on a playing field. The goal of the game is to turn them in a way so that you create a hexagon that contains triangles of the same color. After doing so, you'll be rewarded a set amount of points and the triangles within the hexagon will disappear, with the triangles in the surrounding areas taking their place. The board itself is in the shape of a hexagon, and triangles will continually fall down from the top. Once they hit another triangle, they'll stop moving, waiting for the player to make use of them. If the player has destroyed most of the triangles on the stage, and the amount of triangles is a bare minimum, then they can press the L and R button, or the A and B button, at the same time to cause the triangles that drop to come down faster. The triangles will also start to drop faster as the player progresses through the game.

Once you start a new game, you'll be given just two colors (in the start, green and orange). After six hexagons have been created, then another color will be added to the mix, and will start to drop down from above. In all, the colors, including the ones mentioned, are green, orange, yellow, red, blue, purple, cyan, and a darker green.

After you've reached a certain point in the game's main mode, you'll be given access to the title's endless mode. In endless mode, you'll keep on going for as long as you possibly can, trying to rank up as many points as possible. The game starts similarly to the title's main mode, and new colors will start to drop just as they did in that mode too. The only difference is that it never ends until the player gets a gameover. In order to unlock the staff credits, you just need to create six cyan hexagons in the game's main mode. After doing this the credits will be available on the game's main screen."

Digimon Emerald Project is a GBA ROM Hack by Guzeinbuick based on Pokemon Emerald in English. And it is now available to download. It was last updated on May 22, 2022.

Description

Emerald but with Digimon instead of Pokemon!

Features

350+ new monsters with unique stats, abilities, Typing, and move pools built from the ground up!
No more filler mons!
Every single Digimon is viable! Don’t be afraid to build a team out of your favourite Digimon!
As many as five or even six stages for prominent Digimon!
Custom moves from the Digimon canon!
Every single Digimon has its signature attack! Diversify your strategies with over 350 new moves!
Digidex Entries state criteria for evolution so you never need to feel out of the loop!
Convenient Shop Data
Tired of random encounters? Repels are cheap as heck now. (Also Move Reminders in every shop)
HM Moves are no longer garbage!
Cut now raises ATK, Flash now deals 50 Electric damage and still lowers accuracy, and Rock Smash always goes first. (Suggestions on how to improve Strength, Dive, and Waterfall? Feel free to post a comment. ???? )
EV/IV Checker, Up to Gen VII Abilities and Moves, Reusable TMs, Deletable HM moves, Fairy Type, Physical-Special Split, Poison Survival, BW Repel System, Reusable TMs, etc.
Minor Dialogue Tweaks
Dive is a TM now.
So don’t freak out when Steven gives it to you and you can’t find it at first.

Known Bugs/Glitches

No game-breaking glitches so far. There are a few graphical glitches that can lead to certain awkwardness/hilarity.

When meeting Steven in Sootopolis, he takes you on a magic walk-though-walls trip before finally dropping you off in the Cave of Origin. Again, completely graphical and doesn’t harm the progression of the game. Certainly looks funny though.
Sometimes Cyberdramon will pop out of a rock after you Rock Smash it. It’s catch rate is 0, so don’t waste pokeballs trying to catch it.
Poyomon will evolve into all sorts of wacky things when given DigiEggs. PGE won’t let me edit this for whatever reason so there’s nothing I can do. ????
I haven’t edited the postgame AT ALL. So don’t bother checking out the Battle Frontier unless you feel like entering Glitch City lol
Compatibility

The game runs on mGBA & VBA for Desktop, and MyBoy for Android. It hasn’t been tested with other emulators."

"Donkey Kong Country","","PAL","United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland","Nintendo","Rare, Ltd.","2003-06-06","2","No","Action | Adventure | Platform","Not Rated","After six weeks on sale, it had sold a record-breaking 6 million copies worldwide. The hugely influential Time Magazine rated it the second most innovative product - not just videogame, but - of the year. Donkey Kong Country was the Super Nintendo platformer that the whole world fell in love with - and now you can, too. First, a quick swing around the Donkey Kong family tree.

Donkey Kong Country, originally released in 1994, stars Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong. But 1994's Donkey Kong is actually 1982's Donkey Kong Jr., all grown up, while the original Donkey Kong from 1981 has aged into grumpy pensioner Cranky Kong, who also cameos in this jungle-based runaround. Confused? No need. All you need to know is that this Game Pak is positively stuffed with nigh-on perfect platforming, loaded with bananas and barrels, frogs and fish, and jogging and jumping. Knuckle-drag your way around eight huge worlds, from jungle to snow-coated mountain to factory to glistening underwater wonderland, and discover more secret bits and unexpected extras than a three-layered box of chocolates.

In the quest to rescue their banana hoard from evil croc monarch King K. Rool, Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong work as a team - only one is under your control at any one time, but you can switch whenever you like (or, swap turns with a friend). Donkey is the big guy - big fists, high-jumping muscle-packed legs, and able to fling big old barrels around like so many coconuts. Diddy is smaller, faster, a better swimmer and a longer jumper, and carries barrels in front of him to protect himself from the king's Kremling hordes. Exploiting the simians' strengths is the name of the game. 

Donkey can use his Ground Slap to upturn pesky Klaptrap baby alligators and piledrive along platforms with the terrifying Roll move. Diddy can duck underneath giant bees, use Cartwheel Jumps to reach bonus life balloons, and avoid enemy-colliding catastrophe during minecart rides thanks to his endearing lack of height. Staying aware of each monkey's weaknesses is crucial, too - because if either Donkey or Diddy slips up, you're stuck with the other until you can resurrect his furry counterpart by tracking down a DK barrel. The visuals blew everyone away back in 1994, and they're still remarkable enough to send you flying across the room in century number 21.

Torrential rain, blizzards and lightning tear across the screen; beautiful multi-layered backgrounds are as colourful as a baboon's behind; and the monkeys and their foes possess a meatily realistic 3D look. And there's more to it all than initially meets the eye. When one of your five jungle friends - from the wall-crushing Rambi the Rhino to the gently gliding Espresso the Ostrich - arrives to lend a hand/claw/tusk/fin/etc., they'll help you access a plethora of secret areas.

Great value cameos from surf dude Funky Kong and kissing cousin Candy Kong, some splendid sonics (including a fine remix of the 1981's original Donkey Kong theme) and fishing and dancing minigames for one or two players make Donkey Kong Country a run-'n'-jump marathon that's guaranteed to put a smile on your face. Which reminds us: when a monkey smiles, he's about to attack. Remember that."

Clu Clu Land's story starts with a type of sea urchin, the Unira, stealing all of the treasures in the underwater kingdom of Clu Clu Land. Bubbles, the heroine, sets out to retrieve the treasure. The object of the game is to uncover all the gold ingots in each stage while avoiding the Unira and Black Holes. Ingots usually form a shape such as a heart or a mushroom. The only way Bubbles can turn around to change directions is by means of Turning Posts located throughout the stages. Bubbles can stun the Unira by using a Sound Wave. When they are stunned, Bubbles can push them into a wall to get rid of them and receive points. If Bubbles is hurt by the Unira, she will lose a life. A life is also lost when Bubbles falls into a Black Hole, or when time runs out. The game ends if Bubbles has lost all her lives.

In later levels, the player must pass over the ingots an odd number of times to uncover them, as they will alternate between their uncovered side and a dull side."

Generally, the game brings in more content from the comic books than the movie, particularly considering the villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only concerned itself with Victor von Doom aka ""Doctor Doom"" as its supervillain of choice, the game brings in various characters from the comic books as well - the Mole Man, the Puppet Master, or Diablo, to name a few. The gameplay usually consists of walking the heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies and just as usually the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials.

Featuring nearly ever soccer team in existence and hundred of players, plus tweaks in game play and several new additions. Gamers will first notice the slight changes in controlling their teams. The passing and dribbling controls have been fine-tuned, allowing gamers to control nearly every aspect of the game. Each player has a strength rating that comes into effect when passing, as does the amount of weight players put behind the kick. A new shooting method, called the Optimized Shot Meter, requires more control and attention, as well. All of these realistic details make gamers feel like they're actually in the game and in control of everything. Manager mode now requires players to keep their club's budgets and handle purchases. Players have to decide how much to spend on staff, recruiting, stadium expenses, and other items. Then gamers have to decide if they want to sign with a sponsor to bring in extra income. All of this adds up to create a game that requires managers to really manage their team. FIFA SOCCER 06 contains all of the modes that made the previous FIFA SOCCER games great, including season, tournament, shoot-out, and verses modes.

It can be best described as an Affectionate Parody of the game's ROM hacking community as a whole, though with gameplay that helps it to stand alongside its more serious-minded counterparts.

On a typical day of work, BK winds up snapping after dealing with one particularly annoying customer, killing him before going on the run with life partner Sephiran.

The cast is primarily comprised of various Fire Emblem characters from the series' past, though with occasional memes and (yes) actual people thrown in for good measure. The game is full of secret items and characters, and the gameplay is different enough (featuring high stats across the board and a reclassing system unique to itself) that it's bound to leave a lasting impression on the player, assuming everything else doesn't first.

Hack of Fe8

Features:

A brand new story (with a serious tone) set in a new continent, Ralspar.

31 Mainline Gameplay Chapters, 5 Shop Chapters, 6 Interludes, 1 “War” Chapter, and 1 Unique “Gaiden” Chapter for a total of 44 chapters.

Higher difficulty than Sacred Stones. There are three difficulties, however, and you are able to swap between the difficulty levels at the beginning of each chapter.

Plenty of custom classes, weapons, weapon icons, battle animations, etc. Everything I have is from the very wonderful FeUniverse Ultimate Repository.

The Skill stat is actually relevant! Each point of skill adds 4 to Hit and weapons have been adjusted for this change. It is now exciting when units level skill!

The Luck stat has been made more relevant as well! Every point of Luck now adds 1 point of Crit and 2 Points of Crit Avoid. New formulas are:
Crit Formula: Weapon Crit + Luck + (1/2 Skill)
Crit Avoid Formula: Luck * 2

Custom UI for pretty much every menu!

More unique/effective weapons to increase weapon diversity. Increased number of magical tomes for each magic type.

New maps for each chapter that increase in complexity throughout the hack. Varied objectives in each chapter that also increase in complexity!

A lot of custom music (Some from the Ultimate Repository and some from VGMusic) from some of my favorite games, including Mega Man, Final Fantasy, SNES classics, and more!

Quality of life hacks (Showing HP Bar, Show health to be healed, fast text and unit movement as a default).

Circles Skill System. I love the inclusion of skills with Circles’ patch. I did my best to give every playable character a skill that is useful for the hack. There are several new skills and most skills have been altered numerically in one way or another. Note that enemy units will never get proc skills and that skills are balanced heavily across characters and classes.

Most every chapter has some form of making you work efficiently. It is fairly guaranteed that if you spend too long in a chapter, you could end up paying for it. I did this to encourage the player to work efficiently when possible.

This hack is designed to have a small roster. There are only 16 characters that are recruit-able in the hack right now*. I wanted to make sure that because of the small roster, every character is valuable to the player and must be taken care of. It’s also why no unit can promote until after Level 15. Get those level ups… You’ll need them.

A casual/classic split that is actually divided into three modes. There are the typical casual and classic modes, but in between is a mode I’m calling Casual Punish. In this mode, units who fall return the next chapter with a 25% Max HP reduction that is permanent. This is my way of making the game a bit more iron man friendly, given the point above.

Portraits from the Ultimate Repository

Plenty of secrets along the game!

There is a fully fleshed out NG+ that is available after the game is completed the first time. This mode will allow you some features that change the base Illuminated experience a great deal and offer replayability."

This hack is intended to be played without resetting for lost units. It’s based around every unit having 0mt basic iron weapons and very few weapons with mt being buyable. You’ll have to manage your resources extra carefully and decide where your powerful weapons will be useful and when you can get away with maybe eating a counter while using iron weapons. Please don’t be scared of not resetting for lost units, as the game’s been designed around it and you’ll get plenty of tools to complete the game with! Resetting is always an option, but the intended mode of play is to play ironman-style.
Some features include:

Very few buyable weapons, they’ll all be gotten through chests/drops/villages with two exceptions
0mt basic weapons, like SoV
an emphasis on Player Phase and resource management
A 20 chapter campaign with 2 arcs, 2 gaiden chapters
41 playable characters"

Many years ago, the land was ruled by the forces of darkness. Monsters and dragons alike terrorized the small human populace in Irona. However, one day, a great sage appeared, commanding light and nature, and with the combined might of the sage and her allies, the monsters were sealed using the power of a mysterious tower known as the Spire of Darkness. Following the conflict, the warriors of legend went their own separate ways and founded their own lands, but they all swore fealty to the brother of the great sage, who was crowned Emperor of Irona.

500 years have passed since the time of the Hero of Light. Irona’s Emperor Perseus, a descendant of the first emperor, Hawke, has been acting suspiciously. He and a mysterious mage named Caelia have been reawakening the monsters using the Spire of Darkness. In Norbury, a land on the western end of the continent founded by the master archer Quentin, Duke Robert dies of unknown causes. Tragedy would also strike the duchy of Abrein, a southwestern duchy founded by Bishop Leticia. The son of Duke Simon and descendant of Leticia, Prince Travis, is killed by a surprise ambush by powerful monsters on a scouting mission. This tragic chain of events throws the whole continent into turmoil, pitting the western duchies against the loyalist eastern lands.

11 years after the Great Tragedy, Travis’s younger sister, Princess Aderyn, chooses to fight back. Together with her allies, she strives to save Abrein and to free the rest of the continent from the iron fist of Perseus’s reign."

In this story, you play as the royal family of Magvel, a continent-wide empire, and as the Five Heroes before they attained their legendary status. The player can reach one of two endings: one which is more aligned with canonical events, and a “good” ending for those who can remain virtuous throughout the story by resisting temptations.

The hack has been in the works for around two years. It was made using FEBuilderGBA, while all custom sprites were made using Usenti. The final work contains a prologue, 17 main chapters and 8 mandatory gaiden chapters for a total of 26 chapters. The gameplay is mostly reminiscent of FE6, with many large maps and many deployable unit slots. However, it is balanced around early promotions being the norm rather than the exception.

The peripheral was the brainchild of inventor Paul Wessel, who came up with the concept in the early 2000s following frustrations over his diabetic son intentionally misplacing his glucose meter; he thought that interfacing a glucose meter with a video game console would encourage diabetic children to check their blood sugar levels frequently (a process involving pricking one's fingers with a lancet which could upset some youngsters who may be fearful of needles).

Wessel pitched the project to Nintendo for approval, whose executives in Japan were initially bemused by the idea as childhood diabetes is rare in the country compared to the US. Nintendo eventually gave Wessel their blessing, and Wessel received funding from an Australian investor to develop and release a version of the glucose meter for the Game Boy Advance."

Goemon: New Age Shutsudou! is a Japan only title in the Ganbare Goemon franchise. New Age Shutsudou is a semi-port/remake of Ganbare Goemon: Shin Sedai Shuumei, containing similar levels and plot to the PlayStation title. New Age Shutsudou was developed and published by Konami Corporation in 2002. The game (as well as Shin Sedai Shuumei) gives the Goemon universe a facelift. It takes place in futuristic Japan, Goemon is skinnier and sports a new hair-do, Ebisumaru is replaced with a shy girl who has a crush on Goemon named Ebisu, and Yae is replaced with Yui, a mermaid-like creature. 

 The Impact scenes take place inside of a large mech.
In terms of gameplay, Goemon: New Age Shutsudou! is a fairly traditional side-scrolling action platformer. The player controls either Goemon or Ebisu, attacking enemies with their respective weapons (which can be leveled up three times in terms of power), and gathering coins. Each level is fairly linear in comparison to earlier Ganbare Goemon titles, and at the end of each level the player is taken to a world map. 

Some levels differentiate from this formula. These levels put the player in control of different characters. There are side-scrolling shoot-em-up stages starring characters like Sasuke. The weapon power-up system still works identically here, the gameplay style is just shifted. Additionally, there are stages where the player takes control of Yui, a mermaid-like creature. These stages are underwater. 

New Age Shutsudou marks the return of the first person Impact scenes, which were previously in some of the Super Famicom Goemon games. These scenes put the player in control of a large mech, fighting other robots. The mech is immobile, but is able to melee attack, guard, and fire counter-attacking lasers."

The second game in the series includes a number of paintball pros, different modes, and a level editor. Like the previous game, GREG HASTING'S TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL MAX'D includes a number of different gameplay modes. Players work as part of a team (either AI-controlled or with friends) to take down the opposing team in a number of different environments. The single-player campaign mode takes it a step further, putting players in charge of forming a paintball team from a number of unknowns and turning them into paintball champions. Along the way, players will face off against big-name paintball players, including Nicky Cuba, Matt Marshall, Peter Utsching, and, eventually, Greg Hasting himself. Between tournaments, players can purchase new equipment for their characters and spend accumulated skill points to increase their statistics. The biggest addition to MAX'D is the level editor. This allows gamers to create their own paintball arenas ranging from small to large, cluttered to open. Players can add bunkers, rocks, trees, picnic tables, and many other items to the field. Each map can be shared online or played with computer-controlled opponents. The ability to create and share custom levels online will keep players coming back to GREG HASTING'S TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL MAX'D for some time.

Happy Dawn is a small Game Boy Advance game. Yes, as you just read, in 2024, a GBA game, haha, where a hilarious story unfolds about a day in the life of Carlitos, a boy who wakes up on a new happy day to go to school.

This game was created for the GBAJam 2024.

How can I play it?
Since it’s only for GBA, you should download it and emulate it, although I hope to make a PC port in the future. I recommend that you use mGBA.

What does the DEMO include?
The demo narrates the beginning of the story. Due to time constraints, some NPCs, interactions, and other important plot events had to be cut.

What can I expect for the future?
Mainly graphical improvements; I’m terrible at making art, especially with the console’s limitations. I also plan to add more facial expressions, more animations, more NPCs, and many other things that I can’t think of right now.
More scenarios; many scenarios were removed for the demo, but there will be a few more with fun situations.
Lastly, something that isn’t immediately visible is a refactoring of the code, allowing it to be more scalable in the future.
That would be all. I hope you enjoy the game as much as I enjoyed developing it. Thank you very much for your time, and have a great day!"

In Harry's second year at Hogwarts, bad things are happening. The ancient Chamber of Secrets has been opened, and what lurks within is attacking students. To get through this ordeal alive (and advance the plot) Harry must again complete various challenges. These mostly consist of navigating large mazes - fighting monsters, solving puzzles, flipping switches and pressing buttons for doors to open. Six spells are available to help. As Harry is often in places he shouldn't be, stealth sequences are also a large part of the game. To avoid teachers and prefects, he can sneak around slowly and hide behind curtains. If he is caught, he is thrown out (to try again) and house points can be deducted.

As in other Potter games, there are a lot of collectibles, found both in plain view and in hidden areas. Sets of Famous Wizard cards unlock bonuses, Every Flavour Beans get Harry passwords that let him move through shortcuts in the school and Chocolate Frogs increase his maximum stamina.

In Harry's second year at Hogwarts, bad things are happening. The ancient Chamber of Secrets has been opened, and what lurks within is attacking students. To get through this ordeal alive (and advance the plot) Harry must again complete various challenges. These mostly consist of navigating large mazes - fighting monsters, solving puzzles, flipping switches and pressing buttons for doors to open. Six spells are available to help. As Harry is often in places he shouldn't be, stealth sequences are also a large part of the game. To avoid teachers and prefects, he can sneak around slowly and hide behind curtains. If he is caught, he is thrown out (to try again) and house points can be deducted.

As in other Potter games, there are a lot of collectibles, found both in plain view and in hidden areas. Sets of Famous Wizard cards unlock bonuses, Every Flavour Beans get Harry passwords that let him move through shortcuts in the school and Chocolate Frogs increase his maximum stamina.

Finally, Quidditch is also back in this game, this time in three-dimensional space, viewed from the back."

There were six annual versions of the game released, started with High Heat Baseball 1999, and ending with High Heat Major League Baseball 2004.[1]

The game, featuring the official licensed team and player names from all 30 MLB teams, was created by games company 3DO which subsequently filed for bankruptcy in 2003 soon after the release of the final version of the series, High Heat Major League Baseball 2004. In August 2003, Microsoft purchased the rights to the High Heat franchise from 3DO, however, Microsoft has yet to develop a new title in the series.[2]

High Heat was traditionally known for possessing more simulation-style qualities than competitors World Series Baseball, All Star Baseball, or Triple Play Baseball, but frequently lagged behind in graphical quality. At the core of High Heat?s gameplay was its batter-pitcher interface, which was often hailed as the most realistic of its era.[3]"

Build up powerful combos to defeat enemies which keep getting stronger. Slowly acquire more dice and upgrade them in order to handle the increasing strength of the enemies you face.

Post in the comments which level you got up to!

Hyperspace Roll was influenced by great games such as Slay the Spire, FTL and the board game Escape: The Curse of the Temple.
Controls:

    D-pad - move selection
    A - Accept selection
    B - Back
    START - Accept dice rolls

In the web version, press Esc in order to rebind the controls. Press Esc again to resume the game.

Hyperspace Roll runs on the Game Boy Advance, but also runs perfectly in popular emulators such as mGBA.

This is an entry for the GMTK game jam 2022 with the theme 'roll the dice'. Everything was produced in the 48 hours available in the jam.
Manual:

Hyperspace Roll is a roguelike. If you die, the game ends and you have to restart from the beginning again. It features a lot of random generation (of enemies, power ups, attacks etc), but provides enough tools for you to be able to influence the result of the game. The key to getting far is understanding the game mechanics in order to be able to get further.

It may require a few play throughs before you get really far, so keep working on it and you're bound to get further. See the video in this page to see what a full play through until level 21 looks like.

Note that you do not need to read this manual to be able to play the game. But feel free to take a look to fully understand how to play if you want :).

As of time of writing, itch.io's image uploading is broken. If I am able to upload screenshots properly after the submission deadline, I will do so. Or there is a chance that this magically starts working :).
Controls

In this manual, I will be referring to the controls using the buttons as they would be on a real Game Boy Advance. These by default map to A = z, B = x, Start = Enter but can be customised in the web player by pressing Esc.
Key concepts

The game plays out in 2 phases. Firstly you customise your dice by applying 3 upgrades (you must apply all 3), then, using those customised dice, you fight an enemy ship. If you win, you apply another 3 upgrades and fight the next ship. The enemy ships get more difficult as the game progresses, but you'll also become more powerful!
Customising your dice

When the game starts, and after every enemy you fight, you will have to apply 3 upgrades to your dice. Use the left and right keys to select the dice in the top of the screen and press A to modify it. Below, you will see a net of the dice you are modifying. (net gif credits to wikipedia)

How does this 2d picture mean a 3d dice?
Screenshot - upgrade your dice

You must then pick a face you would like to upgrade. Note that you cannot upgrade a face with itself, or a face with a red border. Select the face with the A button. You can press the B button to go back.

Then select an upgrade. A description of what the upgrade does is provided in game.
Fighting the enemy

Once you have selected your upgrades, you are ready to fight an enemy for this round. Enemies start relatively easy and get progressively harder by having more HP and attacking more often and with stronger attacks.

In order to fight the enemy, you will want to roll your dice and attack with the resulting faces.

Select a dice you want to roll using the Left and Right keys, then press A to roll that dice.
Screenshot - select your dice

Once you are happy with the faces shown, you can press Start to fire! The more dice you have showing the same face, the more powerful the attack will be.

After you've fired, all dice will be re-rolled.

Screenshot - Enemy attacks

As you are playing, the enemy ship will also be attacking you. You can see a timer to the right of their attacks along with the value of that attack to the left of it. Try to get the enemy HP to 0 before yours is!
Enemy

The enemy attacks you in a different way that you attack them. When their timer hits 0, they will trigger their attack. They have a choice of 3 possible attacks, which will increase in power as the game progresses.

Shoot - attacks you with the specified amount of damage. If you have more shield then there is damage, does nothing. If you have some shield, you will negate all damage but lose your shield. If you have no shield, you will take that much damage to your HP.

Shield - if the specified value is higher than the amount of shield the enemy has already, it will give itself that much shield. In order to destroy the enemy shield, you will need to do more damage in one hit then they have shield. Otherwise your attack will do 0 damage.

Heal - heals the specified amount of HP
Malfunctions

One side of  your dice has an ! symbol on it. This is a malfunction (and cannot be removed from the bottom face). If you roll a malfunction, you will not be able to roll it until the cooldown timer has expired.

Note that you can still fire your other dice, you just cannot use any showing the malfunction side until you re-roll it by pressing A with that dice selected.

It is easy to pick up and play, even for the younger players, without worrying too much about what button combination will do what trick.

As such, many of the events experienced in Kingdom Hearts are relived in this game; Sora encounters memory-based versions of Disney characters that he has met before. The individual plotlines differ from those in the original game and revolve around the theme of memory. The exception is the Deep Jungle world which does not reappear in Chain of Memories. Just as Kingdom Hearts had several worlds created specifically for that game, Chain of Memories introduces Twilight Town, in addition to the original worlds of Kingdom Hearts. The world card for Twilight Town was created from memories on ""the other side of Sora's heart""."

"Klonoa Heroes","","Region Not Set","","Namco","","2002-12-13","","No","Role-Playing","E - Everyone","This entry in the Klonoa series sees the floppy-eared hero training to become a true hero in a new RPG system.

Klonoa Heroes: Densetsu no Star Medal is a spin-off of the Klonoa franchise, released only in Japan on December 13, 2002. Klonoa Heroes was developed by Namco and published by Namco for the Game Boy Advance. Klonoa Heroes is a twist on the traditional Klonoa games, putting Klonoa in a more action role playing game along the lines of Legend of Zelda or Beyond Oasis. The game does have voice acting, as well. Kumiko Watanabe plays Klonoa, Takahiro Sakurai plays Guntz, Shouzou Iizuke plays Pango, and Yutaka Shimaka plays Garlen.

Klonoa Heroes' gameplay is very similar to the gameplay of The Legend of Zelda. Players can control one of three characters (Klonoa, Guntz, and Pango) in a top-down perspective, hitting enemies with various attacks (Klonoa with the Wind Ring seen in the platforming games, albeit with a few differences). Guntz uses a handgun, while Pango throws bombs. In addition, these characters can collect more weapons as the game progresses. Every enemy in the game is given a color (either blue or red), and the player must attack that enemy with the corresponding attack (as each weapon has a blue and red attack).

Klonoa Heroes also has role playing aspects. Experience points are gathered by picking up Dream Shards after defeating enemies (failure to pick them up results in no experience). Enemies also drop coins, which can be spent on items and weapons. These items can be found in chests scattered throughout the levels, as well. Most items can be used to restore health, but there are various other uses (such as stat benefits). Leveling up also allows the player to distribute points in several different areas (traditional role playing game stats, such as attack, defense, and agility). These changes are not permanent, and can be changed at any time (when not in the middle of a level)."

It begins when a robot villain named King breaks into Dr. Wily's laboratory and then the Robot Museum to collect the data blueprints for the creations of Dr. Light. Dr. Light alerts the hero Mega Man that he must go at once to the Robot Museum to confront this new enemy. Meanwhile, Bass (Mega Man's rival and Wily's greatest creation) hears of the new criminal's appearance and decides to prove himself the stronger robot by defeating King. Proto Man is the first to arrive at the scene. King divulges his plan to him; he desires to create a utopia in which robots rule the world over humans. To accomplish this, King seeks to create an unstoppable army using the data and invites Proto Man to join him. Proto Man refuses and attempts to attack, but King counters and slices his body in half. Proto Man then teleports back to the lab for repairs while King escapes with the data. With their own motivations, Mega Man and Bass set out to put a stop to King's plans.

After vanquishing eight powerful robots under allegiance to King, the duo infiltrates his castle and engages him in combat. Proto Man interrupts the fight and again attempts to defeat their new nemesis. Putting all of his remaining energy into a blast, Proto Man manages to destroy King's shield and loses consciousness, allowing Mega Man and Bass to best King in battle afterwards. King questions why they fight so hard for humans when robots are the superior species. The pair explains that humans are the ones who created robots in the first place, which confuses King. The villain reveals that his creator is Dr. Wily, who then appears on a video monitor. When King asks the evil inventor why robots fight each other for the sake of humans, Wily strengthens his ""brainwashing level"" and restores his power. Mega Man and Bass engage King in another battle and defeat him. The castle begins a self-destruct sequence and the protagonists escape without King.

Mega and Bass begin a final confrontation with Dr. Wily in his newly-regained laboratory. When Wily is beaten, Bass demands to know why he deceived him. Wily explains that he created King simply to test Bass' abilities because of his past failures in challenging Mega Man. Wily shows him written plans for making a newer version of King to join with Bass in this venture, promising that the two would be invincible together. Proto Man appears and immediately destroys these plans. Proto Man tells Bass that although he is a strong robot of free will, he can never defeat his rival because he has nothing for which to fight. Mega Man returns home where his sister Roll presents him a letter from King. King wishes to atone for his own crimes against humans and hopes for them to be friends if they were meet in the future."

In the violent near future, there existed a war/thrash metal band CYBERPRIEST, whose music brought strength and hope to the hessians struggling from day to day. It consisted of these talented individuals:

FAUSTUS (Bass/Vocals) - a natural leader and perceptive songwriter.
SADOK (Guitar) - an intolerable personality, whose buzzsaw-like playing and dedication more than made up for that (he joined the military for a time just to get war-metal writing inspiration, it appeared).
PHANTASM (Guitar) - her more thoughtful playing and skillful leads brought another side to their music.
GOAT (Drums) - an aspiring Nietzschean Over-Man, who pounded with equal ferocity both his drums and anyone who dared to pick a fight with him.

Just as the band was starting to get notoriety outside their hometown SUB-CITY, SADOK was murdered in an manner very atypical to a metalhead: it appeared to be a job of professional hitmen. His best friend and novice guitarist IAN swore to find those responsible, in the process joining CYBERPRIEST himself. It turned out that SADOK did not die for nothing: he had uncovered a twisted military mass mind control project involving an insane scientist DR.ULTRASHRED. Then, it also turned out he was not dead at all. In the adventures that ensued IAN, PHANTASM and GOAT each took turns unraveling the military's many conspiracies, and finally revealed and brought to justice the mastermind behind them, GENERAL IRONFIST. But all this was not without a price: as IAN and PHANTASM fell in love after their first adventure, CYBERPRIEST dissolved hatefully, and shortly afterwards SADOK died for real during a raid to a supposedly abandoned installation. GOAT went to live in the woods, and FAUSTUS became disillusioned and simply disappeared."

You just shoot things. The real skill though is in knowing just what to shoot and when to shoot it and where some targets reap sizeable rewards others will drain your score in no time at all. One addition to version three is the introduction of protected birds flying around with your intended targets which means that shooting now takes a little more thought than simply blasting into the sky. Other features remain intact and there are still items that need to be avoided such as balloons and various animals on the ground. As usual though you'll need to experiment to find out just what's worth hitting and what's not.

One of the best parts of the Moorhen series has been the hidden bonuses and secrets but they've always been well concealed and you're more likely to discover them by accident rather than actually work them out. I won't spoil some of the goodies we've discovered in this version but Moorhuhn 2 featured spiders that could be spun around trees and the first edition had you shaking trees then shooting down ten leaves for a 100 point bonus. Finally the hi-score chart is still there as is the wonderful battery back up so you can prove that you did actually get a score over 50."

Although I have made attempts to make one myself, I simply lacked the knowledge or dedication to make anything happen. Now, around 10-12 years later, seeing how far ROM hacking has advanced and with more confidence in my skills, I've decided to revisit developing my own ROM hack.

Fire Red enhancement hacks are definitely a dime a dozen these days, so you're probably wondering what this hack has to offer. I personally enjoy difficulty hacks the most, which is why I consider ROM hacks like Clover and Vega to be the two best ones out there.

This hack is at its core a difficulty hack, but with massive additional features added to help you navigate through this game's difficulty.
If I had to draw a comparison it'd be quite similar to Drayano60's enhancement hacks, which provide access to nearly all the Pokemon while also adding relevant buffs to make all sorts of different Pokémon and playstyles viable, but with an insane amount of quality of life features added that also make many gruesome tasks far less tedious.

Your story unfolds within the same timeline as the beginning of Red and Blue's adventure. Since you'll be transferred to Kanto at a certain point, you'll have the chance to witness Red/Blue's story from the perspective of a Team Rocket member. Moreover, you'll get to see everything that happened behind the scenes (here, of course, we delve into theories), aiming for everything that occurs to be considered canonical within the original games.

Therefore, the idea of this hack is that you, as a random Rocket Grunt, can do everything in your power to reverse the classic scenario where Team Rocket and Giovanni are defeated by Red, partly seeking justice by giving a villain our player ability. This will lead to a clash between this and the canonical story (which will be maintained in this hack) that we all know.

All that being said is, albeit a percentage, only the initial part of our adventure (KANTO), as we'll also journey to Sevii, Johto..., we'll see some of the biggest projects that Team Rocket had, with a good portion of the game dedicated to revealing several secrets and theories that many of us may have suspected but were never confirmed, in addition to experiencing events such as the collapse of Lavender Tower, the construction of the train tracks, etc."

Each variant corresponds with a different Eevee evolution. The differences between versions are minor and mostly aesthetic, so it is recommended you go with your favorite!

These variations include:
Opal - Eevee
Aquamarine - Vaporeon
Topaz - Jolteon
Garnet - Flareon
Amethyst - Espeon
Onyx - Umbreon
Turquoise - Leafeon
Quartz - Glaceon
Zircon - Sylveon

Story:
Pokémon Aquamarine opens with the player character having a strange dream. A ghostly figure named Ilex claims that the player has turned into a Mew, and must embark on a journey to return to their human body. The player must be careful as Manta is home to Team Tactix, a group of dubious scientists who study Pokémon genetics. It is thought that the influx of Shiny Pokémon in Manta is due to their experiments. Could they be the ones responsible for turning the player into a Mew?

The game diverges whether the player chooses to play as a boy or a girl. As a boy, the player turns into a regular Mew. As a girl, the player turns into a Shiny Mew. The events of the game vary depending on this choice, similar to the version exclusive changes of the main series.

Features:

"Pokemon Der Erif","Pokemon Fire Red Backwards","NTSC","","","","2012-06-14","1","No","Adventure | Role-Playing | Unofficial","Not Rated","Have you ever thought ""You know, man... if you like, went south of Pallet at the beginning of the game, you would TOTALLY be able to go through Kanto backwards""? Yeah, didn't think so. But a while ago, I did, and I decided to make it a reality.

Fire Red: Backwards Edition (also going by the title Der Erif when I try to seem slightly more creative), is a a hack of Fire Red in which the maps and scripts are messed with in a way that makes the player go through the gyms in the following order:

Cinnabar > Fuchsia > Saffron > Celadon > Vermillion > Cerulean > Pewter > Viridian.

Additionally, there are other changes:

    Many Pokemon have been buffed. In particular, plenty of bugs are stronger.
    Some gym leader TMs have been changed so you don't get overpowered moves early.
    Some typings have been changed. Not many, though.
    Surf has been given a lower base power.
    Cut has been given a higher base power and made steel type.
    Naturally, every trainer has been changed.
    Wild Pokemon have beenc changed as well. This hack has nearly every Pokemon between Gens I and III, with the exception of legendaries and a few others.
    ""Teleport"" is now a psychic type explosion.
    Pokemon appear in puddles, like Gen V.
    There is a postgame, so be sure to make your file saves without savestates.


As the hack has been released on some other forums, I already know a few bugs:

    The move ""Strength"" has broken. It is now 100 pp with no typing. It uses the user's special attack stat.
    In Pallet, the rival doesn't grab the Pokemon he ends up using, if you pay enough attention.
    The move ""Rock Tomb"" causes the game to crash. No Pokemon can learn it, but one trainer's Pokemon has metronome and may use it.
    The map doesn't correspond to the routes aesthetically. This isn't so much a bug as an ""I'll fix it later""."

All Pokemon are found where they normally are, eliminating the need to look at a README file to find out where they are located. If you want to catch all 386 Pokemon, then this hack is not for you. If you want to play through Emerald with the ability to catch every Pokemon present, regardless of version exclusivity or trading requirements, then this hack IS for you!
Features

The changes can be divided into 2 groups; changes that allow for the completion of the Hoenn Dex and quality of life changes/modernizations.
Changes that allow for the completion of the Hoenn Dex

1. Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald exclusives present in all areas

    For example: in Ruby, Zangoose is present in route 114. In Sapphire/Emerald, Seviper is present in route 114. In Emerald Essence, Both Zangoose and Seviper are present in route 114. This is true for every area in the game.

2. Pokemon that normally evolve by trading now evolve at level 37

    For example, Graveler, Machoke, and Kadabra.

3. The starters you did not pick can be found in Desert Underpass

    There will be two Pokeballs in Desert Underpass containing the two starter Pokemon you did not pick.

4. An NPC in the Battle Frontier Pokemon Center will reward you for completing the Hoenn Dex

    If you complete the Hoenn Dex and receive your Diploma from Lilycove City, you will receive Jirachi as a reward.

5. Dragon Scale, DeepSeaTooth, and DeepSeaScale can now evolve Pokemon by using them.

    This will allow Seadra to evolve into Kingdra, Clamperl to evolve into Huntail, and Clamperl to evolve into Gorebyss.

6. An NPC in the Battle Frontier Pokemon Center will give you the Mystic Ticket, Aurora Ticket, Eon Ticket, and Old Sea Map

    This will allow you to travel to Navel Rock, Birth Island, Southern Island, and Faraway Island.

Quality of life changes/modernizations

7. TMs are reusable

    Just like in later Pokemon games, you are free to use TMs as many times as you want.

8. HMs are now forgettable

    Now HMs can easily be replaced by other moves.

9. The running shoes are available from the beginning of the game and you can run indoors

    This makes the beginning of the game less tedious and makes the later game more convenient when indoors.

10. Stats that are affected by natures are color-coded on the summary screen

    Just like in later Pokemon games, the increased stat will be red while the decreased stat will be blue.

11. The Everstone now passes down natures 100% of the time regardless of gender

    This works like in later Pokemon games, instead of only passing down natures 50% of the time and only working with females and Ditto.

12. Egg moves can now be passed down by both parents

    This works like in later Pokemon games, instead of only male parents being able to pass down egg moves

13. When a repel wears off, you will be immediately asked if you would like to use another one

    This works like in later Pokemon games and makes using repels much less tedious.

14. Instead of choosing between the Mach and Acro bikes, Rydel now gives you both

    This makes traversal much easier and requires less backtracking. If you are starting this hack from a previous save file, Rydel will give you the bike you are missing.

15. Move tutors are reusable

    Move tutors can now be used as many times as you want.

16. The Move Reminder no longer requires Heart Scales

    The Move Reminder on Fallarbor Town will now help you relearn moves for free.

17. The TMs for Flamethrower and Double Team can be bought in Lilycove Department Store

    Previously, the only way to get these TMs was through the Mauville Game Corner.

18. Cut content from Altering Cave has been added

    The altering cave was originally supposed to contain various Johto Pokemon that would alternate based on a mystery gift. This never made it into the final game and instead, the cave had nothing but Zubats. Now, the cave contains all the Johto Pokemon that would have been available to catch. These Pokemon are Mareep, Aipom, Pineco, Shuckle, Teddiursa, Houndour, Stantler, and Smeargle.

19. All evolution items can be bought in the Battle Frontier Poke Mart

    This includes: Fire, Water, Thunder, Leaf, Moon, and Sun Stones, as well as Dragon Scale, DeepSeaTooth, and DeepSeaScale

20. Minor dialogue alterations to be consistent with changes

    For example, Roxanne now says that TMs have infinite uses instead of saying they can only be used once."

"Pokémon Emerald Kaizo","","NTSC","","","","2017-06-19","1","No","Adventure | Role-Playing | Unofficial","Not Rated","This is a significantly more challenging hack of Pokémon Emerald, where the player can obtain all 386 Pokémon in the Third Generation.

Certain areas have been redesigned, to keep with the Kaizo theme. Keep a particular eye out on changing bike types. Once you cross an area obstacle with a certain bike type, it is very likely that there will be another that requires the other bike, and vice versa.

Most of the changes are trainer battles, and trainer placements. Sets are all changed, and there are many avoidable overworld double battles, but some may be unavoidable. Gyms follow specific themes, and have different trainers than the original. The Victory Road will be the toughest Victory Road of all the Kaizo Hacks.

Pokémon Battles do not allow the use of any item, except for held items. This is where the difficulty of the game comes from, so make sure you heal yourself before any battle, or else you cannot heal.

There are some small liberties taken in regards to certain story elements, one will fight more encounters with Team Magma and Team Aqua for instance. Magma Admin Courtney, not found in the original, can be fought in this version, for example.

Postgame is heavily changed up. You fight gym leader rematches at their full power, right off the bat. Starting with singles, then moving on to doubles.

To get Rayquaza, the player has to complete Trick House, which involves going through various Kaizo Challenges. However, it opens up only after the Champion is defeated.

There are areas in the game that can only be accessed once one beat the game, which can house a Legendary Pokémon, or some Pokémon that you can only get once you beat the game. This includes event items, so be sure to check for obscure areas in the game, because that is where those items are located. Then you can head to Lilycove and travel to the mysterious destinations.

The game is extremely challenging, but very fun, as the level curves are still steady, and you will be tested by various boss fights. Certain areas in the game are going to be incredibly brutal, and some will be rather grueling. This is not a hack for the faint of heart. It is much more difficult than every third gen hard mode hack.

The goal of the project is to refine and enhance the classic game using over 20 years of hindsight, addressing its known flaws—such as limited Pokémon availability, weak rival and Elite Four design, and underdeveloped story execution—while preserving its nostalgic essence.

Rather than introducing major generational changes like the Physical/Special split or new typings, the game focuses on subtle, Gen 3-faithful improvements. These include enhanced rival and villain storylines, rebalanced Pokémon, better boss fights, an expanded post-game, and a smoother level curve.

How does it work?
When you go on an adventure all routes, encounters and items will be procedurally chosen based on your progress into a run
After a certain number of routes you will encounter a random gym leader who will have a procedurally chosen team of their assigned type; as you progress further into a run gym leaders and other trainers will start using more difficult setups for their pokemon.
If you can make it all the way to the champion and defeat them, then you will have completed the run!

Once you complete or wipe out of a run you will go back to a hub area where you can buy permanent items and catch new ""starter"" Pokemon to use in the next run
As you progress further into the run, you will unlock more buildings/NPCs in this hub area to use for preparing the next run"

"Pokémon Fire Red Backwards","Pokemon Firered Back-wards | Pokémon Rojo Fuego Reverso | Fire Red Backwards Edition (Hack)","Other","","","Game Freak","2012-06-14","1","No","Adventure | Role-Playing","M - Mature 17+","Have you ever thought ""You know, man... if you like, went south of Pallet at the beginning of the game, you would TOTALLY be able to go through Kanto backwards""? Yeah, didn't think so. But a while ago, I did, and I decided to make it a reality.

Fire Red: Backwards Edition (also going by the title Der Erif when I try to seem slightly more creative), is a a hack of Fire Red in which the maps and scripts are messed with in a way that makes the player go through the gyms in the following order:
Cinnabar > Fuchsia > Saffron > Celadon > Vermillion > Cerulean > Pewter > Viridian.

Additionally, there are other changes:
Many Pokemon have been buffed. In particular, plenty of bugs are stronger.
Some gym leader TMs have been changed so you don't get overpowered moves early.
Some typings have been changed. Not many, though.
Surf has been given a lower base power.
Cut has been given a higher base power and made steel type.
Naturally, every trainer has been changed.
Wild Pokemon have beenc changed as well. This hack has nearly every Pokemon between Gens I and III, with the exception of legendaries and a few others.
""Teleport"" is now a psychic type explosion.
Pokemon appear in puddles, like Gen V.
There is a postgame, so be sure to make your file saves without savestates.

As the hack has been released on some other forums, I already know a few bugs:
The move ""Strength"" has broken. It is now 100 pp with no typing. It uses the user's special attack stat.
In Pallet, the rival doesn't grab the Pokemon he ends up using, if you pay enough attention.
The move ""Rock Tomb"" causes the game to crash. No Pokemon can learn it, but one trainer's Pokemon has metronome and may use it.
The map doesn't correspond to the routes aesthetically. This isn't so much a bug as an ""I'll fix it later"".

""But Slike!"" you say. ""Nobody could possiblly be manly enough to go through with this hack! We demand proof!"" you say. This is why, in addition to the nice, happy download I have attached to this post, I have a collection of screenshots:"
"Pokemon Fire Red Essence","Pokemon - Fire Red Essence | Pokemon FireRed Essence","NTSC","","","","2022-10-17","1","No","Adventure | Role-Playing | Unofficial","Not Rated","The goal of this ROM hack is to retain the essence of the original game while allowing you to catch all of the Pokémon that were supposed to be caught in Fire Red/Leaf Green. All Pokémon can be found where they normally are, eliminating the need to consult a README file to determine their location. This hack is not for you if you want to catch all 386 Pokémon. If you want to be able to catch every Pokémon in Fire Red, regardless of version exclusivity or trading requirements, then this hack is for you!
Features

The changes can be divided into 3 groups; changes that allow for the completion of the Kanto Dex, changes that allow non-Kanto Pokémon to be caught, and quality-of-life changes and modernizations.
Changes that allow for the completion of the Kanto Dex

1. Fire Red/Leaf Green exclusives present in all areas

    For example: in Fire Red, Ekans is present in route 4. In Leaf Green, Sandshrew is present in route 4. In Fire Red Essence, Both Ekans and Sandshrew are present in route 4. This is true for every area in the game.

2. Pokémon that normally evolve by trading now evolve at level 37

    For example: Graveler, Machoke, Haunter, and Kadabra.

3. NPCs on Six Island will give you the fossil and fighting Pokémon you did not pick

    If you chose Omanyte, an NPC will give you Kabuto, and vice versa. If you chose Hitmonlee, an NPC will give you Hitmonchan, and vice versa.

4. Pinsir is now available as a prize at the game corner

    Pinsir was available in Leaf Green, so it’s only fair that he is available in this hack too. A level 25 Pinsir is available for 5,500 coins. This option replaces Clefairy as a prize Pokémon.

5. The starters you did not pick can be found in Rocket Warehouse

    There will be two Pokéballs in the final room of Rocket Warehouse on Five Island containing the two starter Pokémon you did not pick.

6. An NPC on Seven Island will reward you for completing the Kanto Dex

    If you complete the Kanto Dex and receive your Diploma from Celadon City, you will receive Mew as a reward.

Changes that allow non-Kanto Pokémon to be caught

7. An NPC on Seven Island will give you the Mystic and Aurora Tickets

    This will allow you to travel to Navel Rock and Birth Island to catch Ho-Oh, Lugia, and Deoxys.

8. Entei, Suicune, and Raikou no longer roam and can now be found at Navel Rock

    In the original game, only one legendary dog was available depending on your starter choice, and it would roam Kanto until you found it. They suffered from two glitches: they always had bad IVs, and if Raikou or Entei used Roar they would be gone from the game forever. Now all three Johto legendaries are available and can be found in Navel Rock.

9. Cut content from Altering Cave has been added

    The Altering Cave was originally supposed to contain various Johto Pokémon that would alternate based on a mystery gift. This never made it into the final game and instead, the cave had nothing but Zubats. Now, the cave contains all the Johto Pokémon that would have been available to catch. These Pokémon are: Mareep, Aipom, Pineco, Shuckle, Teddiursa, Houndour, Stantler, and Smeargle.

10. UP-GRADE, Metal Coat, Dragon Scale, and King’s Rock are no longer held items

    They are now single-use items used to evolve Porygon, Scyther, Onix, Seadra, Poliwhirl, and Slowpoke. They are still found in the same locations and are still the rewards for completing the Trainer Tower.

Quality of life changes and modernizations

11. TMs are reusable

    Just like in later Pokémon games, you are free to use TMs as many times as you want.

12. HMs are now forgettable

    Now HMs can easily be replaced by other moves.

13. The running shoes are available from the beginning of the game and you can run indoors

    This makes the beginning of the game less tedious and makes the later game more convenient when indoors.

14. Stats that are affected by natures are color-coded on the summary screen

    Just like in later Pokémon games, the increased stat will be red while the decreased stat will be blue.

15. Flame body and Magma armor now cut the steps needed to hatch an egg in half

    Just like in later Pokémon games, this makes egg hatching much less tedious.

16. Move tutors are reusable (Except for the one in Cape Brink)

    Move tutors can now be used as many times as you want, except for the move tutor that teaches the ultimate move to your starter in Cape Brink.

17. The Move Reminder no longer requires mushrooms

    The Move Reminder on Two Island will now help you relearn moves for free.

18. Adjusted game corner coin rate

    Instead of paying $1,000 for 50 coins and $10,000 for 500 coins, you now pay $1,000 for 500 coins and $10,000 for 5,000 coins. This makes getting Porygon and some essential TMs much less tedious.

19. Moon stones are now sold in Celedon Department Store, Sun Stones are now sold in Seven Island Mart

    This makes it so Moon stones and Sun stones are no longer finite items.

20. The Silk Scarf and Dragon Fang can be bought from the game corner

    The Silk Scarf replaces the Smoke Ball and the Dragon Fang replaces the Yellow Flute.

21. Minor dialogue alterations to be consistent with changes

    For example: Brock now says that TMs have infinite uses instead of saying they can only be used once."

Their untimely demise was brought about by a series of disastrous earthquakes; all that remains of their society are their temples, idols and story, as relics of the past.

In the present day, local archaeologist and Pokémon Professor, Professor Redwood, has noticed an increase in the region's seismic activity. Propelled by a growing concern for Orbtus' safety, he seeks the assistance of new Pokemon Trainers with a flair for adventure in the rural Celanto Town, a seaside town near the mysterious Totem Poles, and your home! Will you, along with the help of the Professor and your rival, be able to prevent the earth from consuming the region once more?

"Pokémon Garbage Green","Pokemon Garbage Green","Other","","","","2022-06-16","1","No","Adventure | Role-Playing | Unofficial","Not Rated","Have you ever wanted to Nuzlocke a Pokemon game with only bad Pokemon?

Have you ever wanted to do that while doing economic research on resource management and risk-analysis?

If so, Pokemon Garbage Green is the game for you! At long last and over multiple years of development, we're releasing Garbage Green to the public.

Story:
The boundaries of what we couldn't change were set to: Opposing trainers and Pokemon Base Stats/Abilities/Learnsets. Everything else was fair game, but making the ridiculously easy trainers of FRLG difficult took A LOT of creativity and balance testing. That creativity was massively intensified by the main draw of the challenge, gauntlets.

    Our one exception is that Koga's Weezing is lowered to level 39 for exp management between Koga and Sabrina


If you're unfamiliar with gauntlets in romhacks, here's a quick guide to how they work in Garbage Green:

    Many routes, caves, and buildings trap you in and force you to fight many trainers
    The vast majority of healing items are removed from the game and none are buyable before being able to challenge the Elite 4
    All places with gauntlets are non-FLY-able, TELEPORT-able, and Escape Rope-able, so there are no ways to get out
    Thus, managing your team's resources with HP and PP is extremely important
    Many gauntlets are inaccessible after you leave with valuable items hidden behind optional trainers, and one gauntlet requires you get encounters mid-gauntlet


Encounters are designed to be as bad as possible for the upcoming split of the game, and were not oppressively powerful for the previous bossfight. However, because FRLG trainers are very underleveled and easy, for there to be sufficient encounter variety, many Pokemon will never evolve or have had their evolution delayed.

    The question we asked for a mon to be in the game was ""Is Mudkip trash after you can get it in GarbageGreen?"" Not ""Is the Mudkip line trash?""
    For that reason a number of mid-tier mons are available lategame.


The game is optimized for the Nuzlocke challenge - Gauntlets will not work well if you're not nuzlocking as trainers don't reset when you wipe. That being said feel free to enjoy the game in whatever way you like.

If you have any constructive criticism or feedback or notice any bugs, please post them in the forum thread!

Features:

    Edited encounters to have only Pokemon from the National Dex that are bad for FRLG. Every Route's Wild Pokemon has been changed.
    Changed the starters to Slugma, Paras, and Goldeen
    Changed static Pokemon encounters - many encounters that have overworld sprites are now Ditto
    Restricted access to certain areas - linearized Kanto and provided many new NPCs to block off parts
    Made trades an integral part of the resource management, trading good mons for bad mons holding items. You also always have an option to do the trades, because they ask for a mon from a location rather than a specific Pokemon.
    Serious nerfs to PP of many moves to require more resource management. All Setup moves are now 1PP to make it not oppressively strong in bossfights
    All infinitely purchasable TMs have been removed
    The only healing items purchasable are Full Restores at Indigo Plateau
    Rare Candies are sellable for $1 in the Pokemart
    Poison out of battle has been disabled to make poison not an insta-wipe in gauntlets
    EVs have been removed
    Changed the opening cutscene"

Simply put, “Pokémon Modern Emerald” is a modernized edition of the original “Pokémon Emerald” game. This game includes all of the QOL features and improvements that I’ve been looking for since I first played the original game in 2005. Consider this a 2.0 update for the original game. This game is not and will never be a “difficulty hack-rom”. If you want a super difficult version of Pokémon Emerald, there are plenty of good hack-roms available. The idea behind this game is to play it instead of the original “Pokémon Emerald”, especially for those who want a vanilla experience with more features: simple difficulty modes, move splits, QOL features, new Pokémon, new areas, new rematches, and a large, etc.

This hack is a “3rd generation hack,” which means that it does not attempt to mimic later generations. While some features and improvements from later generations are included, this hack is fundamentally a 3rd generation game. Don’t expect to be able to catch all 900 different Pokémon or learn all of the new moves from later generations. This hack does not include the “Battle Engine Upgrade” or anything similar, but it does include some of its mechanics (such as the optional Physical / Special split that occurred in Generation IV or the Fairy Type). There are 423 Pokémon, with two from Generation 8 and three from Generation 9.

In addition, the game is incredibly modular. When you start a new game, a menu that contains dozens of options to customize your experience will appear."

I've been playing Pokémon ROM hacks since I was a kid, starting with Quartz, Ruby Destiny Reign of Legends, and Shiny Gold, all of which helped spiral my obsession, making me a long-time lurker in the community. Although I have made attempts to make one myself, I simply lacked the knowledge or dedication to make anything happen. Now, around 10-12 years later, seeing how far ROM hacking has advanced and with more confidence in my skills, I've decided to revisit developing my own ROM hack.

Fire Red enhancement hacks are definitely a dime a dozen these days, so you're probably wondering what this hack has to offer. I personally enjoy difficulty hacks the most, which is why I consider ROM hacks like Clover and Vega to be the two best ones out there.

This hack is at its core a difficulty hack, but with massive additional features added to help you navigate through this game's difficulty.
If I had to draw a comparison it'd be quite similar to Drayano60's enhancement hacks, which provide access to nearly all the Pokemon while also adding relevant buffs to make all sorts of different Pokémon and playstyles viable, but with an insane amount of quality of life features added that also make many gruesome tasks far less tedious.

This is a joint project with me and a friend koala4; although I've handled pretty much everything on the technical side he's assisted me immensely in balancing, giving suggestions, doing the wild Pokemon locations for the most part, testing, and more."

Shigeru Ohmori, the game’s director, described it as a more modern setting. The region itself is influenced by Great Britain, with many landmarks resembling the Houses of Parliament and the Cerne Abbas Giant. To the south of the Galar region are countryside towns with cottages and Victorian architecture. The region’s center is populated by an Industrial Revolution-style city with steampunk elements.

Many of the region’s towns and cities have Pokémon Gyms designed to look like football stadiums, displaying both Dynamaxing and Gigantamaxing, as implemented by Rose, the Galar Pokémon League Chairman. Much of the region’s northern areas are dominated by snow-covered mountains. The Wild Area, an open world area with numerous roaming Pokémon species, encompasses a large portion of the region’s south-central region. The weather in the Wild Area changes on a regular basis.

Pokémon previously introduced in previous games, such as Weezing, gain regional Galarian Forms with new typings, stats, and appearances, as with Pokémon Sun and Moon. Some Pokémon, such as Linoone and Meowth, can even evolve regionally."

In doing so, you hope to promote the advancement of mankind. It turns out that hope for a better world is a funny thing as nearly everyone has it in some way, but people take their hope in many different directions. Whether their hope is on land, in the water, in the sky, or somewhere else people will push for their dreams. In doing so, they often trample on the hopes and dreams of others all in the name of achieving their goal of a ‘utopia’.

This is the world you are thrust into. Upon joining Team Magma, you become a part of the Hoenn underworld where you soon realize that instead of right and wrong, there are only the weak and the strong. In Pokemon Team Magma Edition you will have the opportunity to work your way up through the ranks of Team Magma, using whatever means necessary (cheating, stealing, etc.) to make Maxie’s vision of a perfect world for humans a reality. Explore Hoenn’s three-way conflict and the toll it takes on the populace.

Intending to gradually ascend within the organization by successfully completing the missions assigned by your superiors.

Your story unfolds within the same timeline as the beginning of Red and Blue's adventure. Since you'll be transferred to Kanto at a certain point, you'll have the chance to witness Red/Blue's story from the perspective of a Team Rocket member. Moreover, you'll get to see everything that happened behind the scenes (here, of course, we delve into theories), aiming for everything that occurs to be considered canonical within the original games.

Therefore, the idea of this hack is that you, as a random Rocket Grunt, can do everything in your power to reverse the classic scenario where Team Rocket and Giovanni are defeated by Red, partly seeking justice by giving a villain our player ability. This will lead to a clash between this and the canonical story (which will be maintained in this hack) that we all know.

All that being said is, albeit a percentage, only the initial part of our adventure (KANTO), as we'll also journey to Sevii, Johto..., we'll see some of the biggest projects that Team Rocket had, with a good portion of the game dedicated to revealing several secrets and theories that many of us may have suspected but were never confirmed, in addition to experiencing events such as the collapse of Lavender Tower, the construction of the train tracks, etc.

Experience the true face of the Kanto region: Discover the reality behind each character once Red disappears from the scene, and the various conflicts and interests within the region, as well as the actual situation in Kanto.
Hierarchical system within Team Rocket. You will ascend as you complete missions, and your appearance will change accordingly.
Currently around 45 hours of gameplay (30-35 hours in Kanto, 10-15 hours in Sevii).
Customized music for most important battles, as well as for numerous unexplored areas in FireRed.
A lot of optional events and sidequests aimed at enriching your role as a Rocket recruit while obtaining unique items and Pokémon.
Countless new maps covering unexplored areas in the original games."

With a love for Pokemon battle, and a burning desire to be the very best, he takes on the region’s Gym Leaders, and eventually conquers the Pokémon League. A well-trodden tale if there ever was one… but it is far from the whole story.

Behind Red’s seemingly simplistic Pokémon adventures lies a darker, more sinister plot – one that its original hero never hears of, but which holds significance for both him and the fate of the Kanto region. Sociopathic scientists, revenge-hungry nurses and corrupt Gym Leaders are just a few of the characters who show their true colors once Red turns his back, and the very people who appeared most friendly and considerate through his naïve eyes may in fact be secretly harboring the most malicious of intentions.

What is the connection between Lance, Giovanni and Professor Oak? What exactly happened during the Great Pokémon War? How was the mysterious Mewtwo created? Not to mention: what is the fate of the hundreds of Trainers Red so ruthlessly defeat? The answers lie in the story behind the story, and it begins deep in Kanto’s criminal underworld…"

"POWDER","Powder","Region Not Set","","Jeff Lait","Jeff Lait","2003-05-31","1","No","Role-Playing","Not Rated","POWDER is a roguelike developed specifically for the Gameboy Advance (GBA). It is not a port of an existing roguelike as the controls of the GBA are very different from the traditional keyboard and the screen imposes some additional limitations. It is built around replayability and long term ergonomics, not short term learning. It uses actual graphic tiles (16x16) rather than the traditional characters. You may wish it didn't as I drew the tiles and am not an artist.

I created POWDER for one simple reason: I wanted a roguelike on my GBA. The standard RPGs were annoying me with endless battle screens against weak enemies to unfold a drug induced plotline. I wanted a game I could just jump into and start killing things. Having had more hours than I'd care to log playing Nethack, ADOM, and the Diablos, I knew the exact type of game I wanted. The problem was I didn't see anyone publishing it any time soon.

This release of POWDER is for anyone in a similar situation who doesn't want to spend the time needed to write a roguelike."

"R-Type III: The Third Lightning","","Region Not Set","","Destination Software, Inc.","Irem Corp.","2004-03-16","1","No","Shooter","E - Everyone","R-Type III was originally released only on the Super NES, but later ported to the Game Boy Advance. The SNES version has been recently released for download at Virtual Console. It was the first game in the series to introduce new Forces. As well as the original Force (which was now named the Round Force, later named as the Standard Force in R-Type Delta), the player could choose from two other Forces: the Shadow Force and the Cyclone Force. These both had new, different weapon sets and special enhancements.
It also refined the weapons and charging system. It reverted to the original Red-Blue-Yellow weapon system, and the Diffusion Wave Cannon from R-Type II was replaced with a more standard wave cannon. Charging this cannon to full beam strength results in a massive, powerful beam that passes through all enemies and obstacles. A new weapon called the Hyper Wave Cannon was also added to the ship, which the player could use instead of the normal wave cannon if who desired. By switching to Hyper mode and supercharging the wave cannon, the ship temporarily gains the ability to use the Hyper Wave Cannon, which is unique among wave cannons in having a rapid fire capability. The shots fired create damaging explosions, and if the player has collected one or two Bits, they spin around the ship burning with energy. However, this Hyper mode causes the ship to overheat after a short while, and it must subsequently spend seconds cooling down, during which time the wave cannon is inoperative.
The fighter in R-Type III is identified in R-Type Final as the R-9Ø Ragnarök; it was originally referred to as 'R-90'. In fact, the original R-90 has been split into three in Final: the R-9S Strike Bomber has the R-90's basic Standard force unit and first wave cannon, identified as Mega Wave Cannon. Final's version of the R-90 has the Shadow Force and Hyper Wave Cannon, but is unable to choose its Force or switch between Wave Cannons. Finally, the R-9Ø2 Ragnarok II has the R-90's final Force, the Cyclone Force, and the Giga Wave Cannon, which can be charged through 7 loops. It can be assumed that this is because the original R-90 would simply be too powerful for the game to be any kind of challenge."

"Rhythm Tengoku","Rhythm Heaven | Rhythm Heaven Silver | リズム天国","NTSC-J","Japan","Nintendo","J.P. Room","2006-08-03","1","No","Music | Party","Not Rated","A rhythm-action game like no other from the same team that created WarioWare. Rhythm Tengoku contains 48 minigames that put your rhythm to the test in a variety of crazy scenarios.

Rhythm Tengoku was developed by Nintendo R&D1 and released exclusively in Japan for the GBA in 2006 and in arcades with Sega's help in 2007. Being developed by the same studio responsible for the WarioWare games, Rhythm Tengoku mixes the mini-game based gameplay with rhythm game elements, featuring unusually high-quality music for a GBA game. The game started development in 2004. A 2002 prototype for a GBA drum sequencer was incorporated into Rhythm Tengoku as well: the player can freely drum within the Sound Test or take on 19 drum lessons. (Source)

The game contains eight stages with five rhythm games and one remix of the previous five each, adding up to 48 different mini-games total. Each game can be completed without hitting every note perfectly, although doing so will unlock various rhythm-related bonus games and modes, such as a drum set where you have to mimic what the drummer does.

Much like the Wario Ware series of games, Rhythm Tengoku is all about following your senses and trying to be aware of various cues in the visuals and audio. This emphasis on sense instead of language makes it quite easy for anyone to pick up and play, even though the game is entirely in Japanese (and consequently only available in the Asian region or through an import website).

For example, one of the game's levels has you rapping with a computer-controlled character. He'll speak a colour-coded Japanese phrase, and the player must press 'A' in different rhythms. Although the game explains what rhythms to do for which phrase, non-Japanese speaking players can watch hand movements on-screen to figure it out without the need for language.

Occasionally, challenges will crop up, asking you to complete a level without any mistakes. Doing so earns you a certificate for that level, and a pink heart with a 'P' on it appears in that level's description."

Sangokushi Eiketsuden (""Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Brave Hero Biography"") is a spin-off of Koei's strategy series Sangokushi, or Romance of the Three Kingdoms, that focuses on a single major character from the conflict.

In this case, the central character is the noble general Liu Bei of the Shu kingdom of the Three Kingdoms conflict. Koei would create other Eiketsuden games that focuses on single characters from their Sangokushi and Nobunaga no Yabou (Nobunaga's Ambition) franchises, such as Sangokushi Koumei Den and Oda Nobunaga Den.

The game was first published on PC in early 1995. It was followed by Super Famicom, Saturn and PlayStation ports several months apart. It would also be adapted for the Game Boy Advance in 2005.

The game splits its time between strategic battles featuring multiple soldier units and an ""adventure"" mode where Liu Bei visits towns, discusses topics with NPCs, purchases new equipment and recruits for his army. He is usually accompanied by his sworn brothers Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.

During battles, players select which units to take into combat with them (though several major characters, like Liu Bei, are mandatory) and fight skirmishes with the enemy units. Depending on the player's choices in combat and in the adventure mode, the story may branch and they can end up fighting different battles."

"Shining Force: Resurrection of the Dark Dragon","","Region Not Set","","Sega","Amusement Vision, Ltd.","2004-06-08","1","No","Role-Playing | Strategy","T - Teen","Shining Force is a turn-based tactical RPG. Battles take place in square grids, and each unit occupies one square. Each unit can move up to a fixed amount of squares along the battlefield, determined by its Move statistic. Depending on its location relative to enemies and to allies, a unit can also perform one action: attack, cast a spell, use an item, or search the area. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping items, don't count as actions. The order of turns is determined by the unit's agility score and a random seed.

As is most common for the RPG genre, units become stronger by fighting enemies or by performing other actions in battle, such as healing allies. These actions give the units experience points (EXP.), which allow them to gain levels.

In Shining Force, each allied unit is represented by a character with his or her own background and personality, much like in the Fire Emblem series. Although there are no ""generic"" units, except on the enemy side, most characters contribute little or nothing to the plot upon joining the player army.

Each allied unit also has a class, which defines a set of abilities for that unit and determines the spells and equipment they have access to. A unit can be promoted to another class at any level between 10 or 20. Upon promotion the character's level resets to 1 and statistics are reduced by a fixed amount, although they begin higher if the character had been promoted at a higher level.

Battle goals for the player are fairly simple: kill all enemies, kill the enemies' leader, or advance to a town or landmark. The enemy side wins if they kill the player's leader, Max, or if the player chooses to escape the battle by casting Egress. Even if the player army is defeated, the player can recover allies and retry the battle. The Force keeps any experience that is obtained, regardless of the battle's outcome. Thus, there is no Game Over, and the player's army gets stronger even upon its defeat, although Max's death results in the player losing half of their money.

Most games in the Shining Force series (with the exceptions of Shining Force CD, all three Game Gear games, all five cell phone games, the Shining Force III premium disc, the Shining Force for Palm Pilot game, and Shining Force Feather) also possess an exploration mode that occurs outside of battle. This gameplay mode is essentially a Japanese-style traditional RPG game, along the lines of Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, although there are no labyrinths and few puzzles to solve. In this mode, the player's army is represented by Max, who is able to walk around, interact with people, find treasure, buy equipment and items, outfit the army, and choose which of the army's members will be used in battle."

Go for a spin around Yoshi's island.

Baby-sitting a whiny newborn is about as fun as a head cold on the first day of summer vacation. But when Baby Mario falls from the sky, the Yoshies seize the opportunity to do a lot more than change diapers.

The big-hearted Yoshies vow to reunite Baby Mario with his twin brother on the far side of the island. It won't be easy, but the Yoshies are determined to take on a meddling Magikoopa and his entire cast of underhanded underlings.

Brilliant game-designer Shigeru Miyamoto has crammed the island's jungles, caves and snowcapped peaks with one brain-bending surprise after another. Hidden rooms, secret passages, charming minigames, demented bosses and all-new pals await your discovery.

Sure, Yoshi looks cute, but he packs some pretty amazing firepower. He can jump, hover, stomp, pound the ground and slurp up enemies. Best of all, he can throw eggs. Heck, Mario even gets to presto-chango into superfast Superstar Mario, while Yoshi morphs into a toy submarine that shoots itty-bitty torpedoes.

As an added bonus, Yoshi's Island includes six super-challenging levels developed just for the GBA. You can also take a break from baby-sitting duties to indulge in multiplayer Mario Bros. action.

While planning the perfect vacation on Dinosaur Island, things go awry for Mario and Luigi when they learn that Princess Toadstool has once again been kidnapped by the ever-diabolical Bowser. Being chivalrous plumbers, Mario and Luigi set out on a massive adventure to rescue their long-time friend. To reach their goal, they'll have to crush Bowser's Minions and solve some of the most challenging puzzles they've ever faced.

Players can choose to play as either Mario or Luigi before entering a level. Mario is more speedy than his brother, and Luigi can float in the air longer than his pudgy sibling (a new feature in the Super Mario Advance version).

By collecting power-ups, both brothers can take advantage of awesome special abilities. A Mushroom makes Mario grow, a Fire Flower allows him to shoot fireballs, and a feather equips Mario with a Cape. The Cape can be used to eliminate enemies, or it can also enable Mario to fly briefly if he has enough space to get a running start.

Other moves include a block-breaking Spin Jump and the ability to carry items like Shells and P-Switches. P-Switches turn blocks into coins and vice versa, which provides plenty of fodder for fun, perplexing puzzles. Another great gameplay feature is the ability to ride Yoshi. In fact, Yoshi's very first video game appearance was in Super Mario World. When riding Yoshi, Mario or Luigi can make their dino pal slurp up enemies, regurgitate fireballs and carry special items.

Like any Mario game, Super Mario World is crawling with secrets. In addition to hidden blocks and vines within the levels, many levels feature hidden exits which take a lot of exploration to discover. Finding these hidden exits is the only way to explore all of the levels in the game."

This initial skirmish ends in a defeat for the Aerogaters, prompting them to sue for negotiations with the Earth Federation Army.

It was developed by Krome Studios and published by Sierra Entertainment for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube and Game Boy Advance. Amaze Entertainment developed the Nintendo DS version.

The game utilizes the voices of celebrities, featuring Elijah Wood as the voice of Spyro, comedian David Spade as Sparx, Cree Summer as Cynder and Gary Oldman as Ignitus. Krome Studios planned to make a Crash Bandicoot game, but Sierra Entertainment asked them to develop The Legend of Spyro instead. The game has also been noted for beginning a more dark and complex plot to the Spyro series. Its success spawned two sequels and a planned CGI movie.

The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning uses a more action-based focus than previous Spyro games. Rather than the previous focus on platforming, the gameplay is now more combat based. Spyro has a variety of combat moves as well as four different breath attacks: fire, electricity, ice and earth, which he can use as both long range and short range attacks. Spyro can also use furies, huge blasts of elemental energy. The game has fewer levels than previous Spyro games, with six levels that progress from a starting point towards a final destination and boss encounter in a linear fashion, and two rail shooter style flying levels adjoining them.

It is the second game in The Legend of Spyro trilogy, released for the PlayStation 2, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, Wii and mobile . It was the last game officially released for the Game Boy Advance in Europe.

It utilizes voice talent by Elijah Wood, Gary Oldman (reprising their roles of Spyro and Ignitus respectively), and Billy West (as Sparx, replacing David Spade). Kevin Michael Richardson (as Terrador and Gaul) and Mae Whitman (as Cynder, featuring recycled voice clips of Cree Summer from its predecessor) were also confirmed to be part of the cast during Sierra Gamers' Week 2007.

The gameplay is similar to its predecessor. Spyro must travel to the end of a level in a linear fashion and defeat the boss at the end of each level, defeating enemies with his combat moves. However, there is a much larger emphasis on exploration and puzzle-solving.

Spyro will learn different breaths from the Chronicler, who is met in Dreams which occur to Spyro during the course of the game. The breaths are tools for defeating enemies. They come in different elements; fire, ice, electricity and earth. Spyro can also use furies, which are big blasts of elemental magic. Spyro is required to obtain a certain amount of purple gems to be able to use these skills.

Spyro is able to learn the skill of ""dragon time"" from the Chronicler. This skill allows Spyro to slow down time. He can use this ability to jump on platforms which are too fast to land on with his normal speed. He can also use this ability to defeat enemies more easily.

Throughout the levels there are forty quills. Each quill collected gives the player 5 pieces of concept art."

The quest begins when Link is chosen by the king of Hyrule to seek the help of the Picori after Vaati, searching for the Light Force, had destroyed the Picori Blade, releasing evil monsters into Hyrule, and turning Princess Zelda into stone. Link learns he was chosen because only children can see the Picori.

Soon into the voyage, Link finds and rescues Ezlo, a living green cap with a bird-like head. Ezlo joins Link by riding on his head as a cap. It will later be revealed that Ezlo and Vaati are actually Minish. Ezlo explains to Link that he is a renowned sage and craftsman and Vaati was his apprentice, but Vaati became corrupted by the madness and hatred of men and took a magic hat that Ezlo had made for the people in Hyrule. The hat grants any made by the wearer, and Vaati had wished to become a powerful sorcerer. Vaati then turned Ezlo into his cap form.

With the help of Ezlo, Link retrieves the four elemental artifacts and brings them to the Elemental Sanctuary, which is a gateway between Hyrule and the Picori homeland. There, he uses the elemental artifacts to turn the Picori Blade, restored by the Picori, into the Four Sword, capable of defeating Vaati. During Link's quest, Vaati teleports into Hyrule Castle and assumes the form of the king of Hyrule, ordering his soldiers to search for the ""Light Force.""

After Link restores the Four Sword, Vaati turns Hyrule Castle into Dark Hyrule Castle. Link fights Vaati just before he can drain Zelda of all of the Light Force hidden within her, which would have killed her in the process. Link defeats Vaati, who shapeshifts into different monsters. When Link and Zelda flee from the collapsing castle to the Elemental Sanctuary, they are once again confronted by Vaati, who changes form one last time.

After Vaati is defeated, Ezlo returns to his original form. He takes the recovered cap of wishes that he created and gives it to Zelda. She combines the cap with the Light Force energy and wishes for all who have been cursed by Vaati to be cured, Hyrule Castle to be turned back to normal, and the monsters in Hyrule to no longer exist. The cap disappears after granting this wish, and Ezlo gives Link a new hat before returning to the land of the Minish."

The quest begins when Link is chosen by the king of Hyrule to seek the help of the Picori after Vaati, searching for the Light Force, had destroyed the Picori Blade, releasing evil monsters into Hyrule, and turning Princess Zelda into stone. Link learns he was chosen because only children can see the Picori.

Soon into the voyage, Link finds and rescues Ezlo, a living green cap with a bird-like head. Ezlo joins Link by riding on his head as a cap. It will later be revealed that Ezlo and Vaati are actually Minish. Ezlo explains to Link that he is a renowned sage and craftsman and Vaati was his apprentice, but Vaati became corrupted by the madness and hatred of men and took a magic hat that Ezlo had made for the people in Hyrule. The hat grants any made by the wearer, and Vaati had wished to become a powerful sorcerer. Vaati then turned Ezlo into his cap form.

With the help of Ezlo, Link retrieves the four elemental artifacts and brings them to the Elemental Sanctuary, which is a gateway between Hyrule and the Picori homeland. There, he uses the elemental artifacts to turn the Picori Blade, restored by the Picori, into the Four Sword, capable of defeating Vaati. During Link's quest, Vaati teleports into Hyrule Castle and assumes the form of the king of Hyrule, ordering his soldiers to search for the ""Light Force.""

After Link restores the Four Sword, Vaati turns Hyrule Castle into Dark Hyrule Castle. Link fights Vaati just before he can drain Zelda of all of the Light Force hidden within her, which would have killed her in the process. Link defeats Vaati, who shapeshifts into different monsters. When Link and Zelda flee from the collapsing castle to the Elemental Sanctuary, they are once again confronted by Vaati, who changes form one last time.

After Vaati is defeated, Ezlo returns to his original form. He takes the recovered cap of wishes that he created and gives it to Zelda. She combines the cap with the Light Force energy and wishes for all who have been cursed by Vaati to be cured, Hyrule Castle to be turned back to normal, and the monsters in Hyrule to no longer exist. The cap disappears after granting this wish, and Ezlo gives Link a new hat before returning to the land of the Minish."

The three Vikings will have to combine their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big lizards and more.

The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.

The player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses them all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and the level must be restarted.

Blizzard re-released the game for the Game Boy Advance in 2003. The GBA port is identical to the SNES version, but the password feature has been removed and replaced with three save slots, meaning the player cannot replay any level at any time."

"Tomato Adventure","Tomato Adventure (Japan) (En) (v1.1.1) (Unknown W. Brackets)","Other","","Nintendo","Graphic Research Co., Ltd.","2002-01-25","1","No","Role-Playing","Not Rated","From AlphaDream and Graphic Research, Tomato Adventure is an RPG released only in Japan. Taking place in a kingdom with tomatoes abound, the gameplay is similar to that of the Mario & Luigi series.

Tomato Adventure, in terms of gameplay mechanics, is the predecessor of the Mario & Luigi series of games, even having its engine reused in the first installment on the GameBoy Advance. Originally developed for the Game Boy Color, Tomato Adventure transitioned to its successor, the Game Boy Advance, when the latter was released. The main difference between the two versions is believed to lie in the quality of audio and graphics, although little substantial information exists on the Game Boy Color version.

Tomato Adventure incorporates a number of RPG standards such as leveling up and travelling to various places to advance the plot. However, the battle system itself is substantially different than most games in the genre, as players have a more active role in how the fights turn out. During the player's turn, they can select a character's attack and then their target. From there, they must perform one of a number of different minigames which determines how successful the attack is. These range from simple button mashers to stopping a meter at a specific point. While attacks can land without reaching the optimal point, their effectiveness tends to be severed in the process. Additionally, each attack has a separate amount of usage points which dictate how many times the player can use that specific attack before needing to revitalize themselves."

The GBA game puts players in control of the web-slinging Spider-Man as he does battle with Venom and other enemies while getting help from some familiar superheroes. The story of Spider-Man begins when 15 year old Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider. He soon realizes he has the ability to climb walls and to sense things. Shortly after being bitten, Peter and friend Eddie Brock discover a mysterious black suit that their fathers created before their deaths. Eddie ends up putting on the suit, which turns him into the powerful villain known as Venom. Peter must battle his childhood friend and other villains like the Green Goblin, Carnage, and Electro to save the city. In story mode, players can walk around New York City as much as they wish as they accomplish side-missions or move the plot along. Instead of walking, though, Spider-Man can shoot webs onto tall buildings and swing his way around the city while capturing gang members and stopping crimes.

There is a hexagonal grid of coloured blocks at the top of the screen, while the player's character sits on a boat floating in water. Unlike Puzzle Bobble, it is able to move side to side. There are multiple weapons that can be used, however the only weapon the player has to start with is a bazooka. As with Worms, holding down the fire button increases the power behind the weapon's launch, affecting how far it will travel. It is possible to fire the bazooka (and some other weapons, such as the grenade and dynamite) in an ""arch"", allowing players to reach difficult areas.

Shooting blocks will have one of two effects:

If you hit a block that is either the same colour as your bazooka missile, or is a rainbow block, that block and any other same-coloured or rainbow blocks connected to it will be destroyed. Any blocks that are not the same colour will not be affected; however, if the only thing holding those blocks up is the coloured blocks you have just destroyed, those blocks will fall into the water.

If you hit a block that is a different colour from your bazooka missile, or is a ""dead block"" - an uncoloured, grey block - it will be recoloured to match the missile.

Like its predecessors, Worms World Party involves controlling a team of worms and using a collection of weaponry to eliminate the opposing team(s). The worms can walk and jump around and use tools such as the ninja rope and parachute to move to otherwise unreachable locations.

The worms have an arsenal of dozens of weapons, ranging from longbows to bazookas and from fireball to Holy Hand Grenades. There are also an array of special weapons, such as Armageddon (meteor shower) or the end-all, be-all Concrete Donkey. Some of these weapons are present in the worms' initial arsenal while others can be collected from randomly appearing crates during the game. For some weapons, such as grenades, holding the launching key longer shoots them further. The landscape can be deformed with any weapon, forcing the players to adapt to changing environments. Also, in addition to the nature-made obstacles, the maps may contain land mines which explode when a worm comes close to one, and barrels which explode when shot, spreading out some burning napalm. These often lead to fancy combinations where, for example, a worm is first hit with a grenade and is then thrown against a mine which sets off another worm, which hits a third worm who slips into the water."

The main objective of the game is to build a strong deck from cards won after duels from the main cast from the English second season anime.

With a vague plot many different challenges are available, but the significant part of the game is ""The Pyramid"". Once the five Ghouls are defeated, Téa, controlled by Marik Ishtar, will lead you to the Pyramid, a five-game challenge in which the player cannot lose or they would have to start over the Pyramid. The Pyramid is organized into chambers. The first duel is against Téa controlled by Marik; the second and third duels are against 2 of the 5 ghouls at random. The fourth duel is against Joey Wheeler controlled by Marik; in the 5th and final chamber, you face Marik, and if you beat him, The Pyramid is cleared.

Once beaten, card limitations will be available once all 10 Card Limitation Duels are complete against a CPU. There is then an option to change card limits on or off (e.g. the trap card Mirror Force would then be open to have two or three cards in a deck; not only one, as this is called 'Free Mode'.) Prior to this Ghouls would be open to duel and the Card Limitation tournaments would be available to use permanently. Many side challenges are always available, and can be useful to use."

At the outer reaches of the universe, thehuman inhabitants on the Planet Zi remain locked in combat. The population, divided between good and evil, uses gargantuan life forms called Zoids to battle each other for control of this world. During a recent weapons experiment, Planet Zi underwent an accidental time-space fusion, creating a collision of Zoids warriors from two eras, the Chaotic Century and the New Century.

This is my reboot of Pokémon, think of it as a new Generation I. This isn’t a Gen III hack, this isn’t a Gen IV/V wannabe hack, this is Chaos Rush’s Generation I game.

STORY: This world is inhabited far and wide by creatures called Pokémon. For some people, Pokémon are pets. Others use them for battling. There are numerous mysteries surrounding them, and they are a popular subject of research. Either way, humans live in harmony with Pokémon, and they have done so for ages.

Meanwhile, three teenagers, two from Pallet Town and one from Viridian City, decide to travel through the Kanto region to collect eight badges of Kanto, and to take on the Pokémon League Challenge. The names of the teens are Red, Green, and Blue, and they each have received a Pokémon from Professor Oak. They have no idea what awaits them, such as an increasingly threatening crime organization known as Team Rocket. The three of them will meet many people on their journey, some helpful, such as Blue’s older sister Daisy. They will also meet Kamon, a younger boy who claims to despise Team Rocket, and is always right on their tail. What are Kamon’s motives? Or more importantly, what are Team Rocket’s motives?"

a mystery-puzzle-roguelike with permanent and per-run upgrades, characters to unlock, and a compelling mystery to unveil! ​


This is a big one. THE DizzyEgg - yeah, the same DizzyEgg who's responsible for pokeemerald-expansion, although he would never phrase it like that - saw something in the convoluted puzzle and story romhaikus I've made in the past, and teamed up with me to make something really different from a traditional Pokemon experience! So many custom features were made just for this, and for once I wasn't terribly limited by my mediocre coding skills. And so the scope was massive - we spent far too many sleepless nights scripting, drawing, and writing to get this done. A more elaborate re-release is planned, too!

We made this for Team Aqua's Romhacking Contest 2, with the theme Myth! (Remember that theme, because if you've played anything I've made before, you know I'm downright manic about doing something new with themes!) Please enjoy, and tell us about any bugs you've found or things you liked!

And, definitely ping us if you play it on stream!"

The Unown's waves, combined in various ways, transformed Mew into completely new beings, but in order to bring balance to the ecosystems, the Unown needed help. Some entity had to coordinate them, thus Arceus created the Unown King, whose instructions would eventually bring life to the species that we know to this day.

For some reason, however, the Unown King is said to have been sealed inside a temple, which is simply referred to as the Temple of the Unown King. It's unclear why, because its story was never written… or was it?

Apparently, the temple itself is home to inscriptions that allegedly tell the rest of the story, but unfortunately nobody has been able to read them. Will you be the first to decipher them and learn the truth. Find all the Unown scattered inside (and outside!) the Temple of the Unown King and find out what those inscriptions say with their help!
