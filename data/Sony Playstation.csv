In battle, you can call on Poms, small weird creatures that will help you in battle if you attack them. They can support you, or they can attack your enemy. Their attacks also depend on how much they like you so you have to stay friends with them. These poms also have their own village that you have to build and govern, a bit like sim city.

"Ten Made Jack - Odoroki Manenoki Daitoubou","","NTSC-J","Japan","Enix Corporation","","2000-03-23","1","No","Action | Adventure","E - Everyone","Jack and the Beanstalk is a folktale said by English historian Francis Palgrave to be an oral legend that arrived in England with the Vikings. The tale is closely associated with the tale of Jack the Giant killer. It is known under a number of versions.

In the Jacobs version of the story, Jack is a young lad living with his widowed mother and struggling in hard times. Jack is in love with the count's daughter and wishes to marry her. In desperation for money, Jack is sent by his mother to sell their only cow at the market, but along the way, he is apparently swindled by a man who offers him supposedly ""magic"" beans in exchange for the cow.

Jack took the beans but when he arrived home with no money, only a hand full of beans, his angry mother threw the worthless beans out the window and sent Jack to bed without supper for his foolishness.

As Jack slept, the beans germinated in the soil, and by morning a gigantic beanstalk grew in their place. When Jack saw the huge beanstalk, he immediately decided to climb it. He arrived in a land high up in the clouds that happened to be the home of a giant.

However, Jack was saved by the giant's wife and as he escaped from the castle, he took a bag of gold coins with him. However, this would not suffice to please the all-powerful count. Jack desired to seek out more treasures from the castle, to gain standing among his fiancee's family. He climbed once more up the beanstalk. This time he stole a hen that laid golden eggs. This would be sure to please the all-powerful count.

Jack, nearly caught by the giant twice, decided that none must know where he found this magical item, and the gold coins so he decided to go up the beanstalk. This time, a magical harp that played by itself, caught his eye. He stole it and then killed the giant in a murderous rage, for the all-powerful count must never know of his misdeeds. With the blood on his hands, he quickly climbed down the beanstalk and cut it. However, this was the giant's blood and could not be washed off of his hands. The all-powerful count was most pleased with these gifts, and so he disregarded Jacks' blood-stained hands. Jack married his beloved and knew riches for the rest of his days.

Ten Made Jack (Tenma de Jack - Odoroki Manenoki Daitoubou) is an intriguing release from Enix based loosely on the Jack and the Beanstalk fairytale. Jack must escape up the beanstalk as he is being pursued and must reach the goal within the time limit.

There are a host of enemies in the way though and flowers have to be rescued too. Water bottles are on hand to help the beanstalk grow in the right places, put out fires or delay the progress of enemies. A bit different, but special too.

The gameplay is really hard, in each level there is a main enemy that is a human character that will pursue the player around the level and can't be destroyed, and there are animal enemies around the level that can be used when they are knocked to knocked the human enemy for some few time, some animals keep appearing until you destroy a bird cottage that are near them, to complete each level the player has to reach to the goal.

This game just like the other 2 games in the series is a futuristic city based adventure with our heroine, Sylvie working with the GPO to keep law and order. The game takes place in the year 2091 and begins when the player character's (Fujita) is wake up in his bedroom to go with his team (Reika, Kyouma & Shinya) to defeat a group of enemies that is attacking the city. The battle this time are a little different since the player can only stop the fights to give orders (change formation, etc).

Based on the Playstation game series there was an anime OVA six episode series known as Melty Lancer: The Animation.

The eponymous Melty Lancer is actually a six-woman team of detectives from the Galaxy Police Organization, a name that apparently wasn't trademarked by Tenchi Muyo. Though the unit was once disbanded, the GPO directors inexplicably see fit to recruit a prisoner named Collins and give him command of the newly re-conscripted Melty Lancer.

Former group leader Melvina MacGarlen is an dignified, pseudo-aristocratic fencer who wears a concerned frown ninety percent of the time; the brash tomboy Jun Kamishiro fights in a suit of combat armor, hates math, and kind of likes Collins; the blond, methodical investigator Sylvia Nimrod has a family history with the GPO; the soft-spoken and optimistic Sakuya Lansaihe is a priestess from the Church of St. Archanest; the staff-wielding, furry-eared Angela is a genetically engineered girl soldier; and the bratty Nana is a magician from a parallel dimension.

Collins, assigns Melty Lancer to trivial tasks at first, but the unit eventually notices a number of crimes leading back to the name ""Iyonesco."" Whatever Iyonesco is, it's able to direct an efficient terrorist cell known as Defiant as well as a group of goofball criminals who dub themselves the Vanessars in honor of their highly annoying boss, Vanessa. While facing off against Defiant, the women of Melty Lancer also run across a cute gerbil-fox named Mou Mou, a slimy bubble-creature, and a lot of perplexing clues about Iyonesco.

The goal of the game is to find a treasure on a southern island, and also become friends with the girls.

The playstation game was released on 1997.10.16. The first edition came with a 50 page Character Guide Book. The game features 10 different mini games and unlockable character artworks.

STORY:
The player is on a southern island called Suzunari Jima. The 15 girls from Seika Joshi high school are also on the island for summer vacation.

The game starts as the master of the hotel tells a story of a hidden treasure on this island. Since many of the girls are pretty bored on the island, they decide to go look for the treasure.

Each day, the girls break up into several groups, and go looking for clues in finding the treasure. There are ten different locations on the island, and there are three times during the day (morning, noon, afternoon) that the player/girls can go to these locations. Then during dinner, everyone talks about what happened that day and makes plans for the next day.

Even though the girls make plans for the next day, they don't necessarily have to go there. Also since there are three times during the day, the girls will visit other locations too.

GAMEPLAY:
The basic idea of Sotsugyou Vacation is to go to the various locations during the day, to look for clues of the treasure, and to become friends with the girls. The game takes place from August 2 to August 30.

At dinner time, the girls will all gather and talk about the day's events and the next day's plans. There will be seven ""groups"" every day. (Three of the girls going out alone, two pairs, and two larger groups.) Each group will plan to go to a certain location, and will usually go there once during the day (either morning, noon, or afternoon).

Each day, the player chooses which location he wants to go to in the morning, noon, and afternoon. He can go to the same location every time, or different locations. The player's previous actions don't affect which locations the girls go to. But the player's actions do affect what happens when you meet the girls.

The daily events of the player are as follows.
* choose the location for the morning
* choose the location for noon
* choose the location for the afternoon
* listen to the girls at the dinner table
* [option] save the game, modify game settings
* [sometimes] one of the girls come to talk
* sleep

Twenty-one years later Heihachi, now the head of a corrupt corporation, organizes a fighting championship his son is eager to join.

Tekken is a versus fighting game similar in concept to Virtua Fighter. Besides Kazuya, other fighters of the tournament all have their own range of moves, something to prove, and a reason for any combat opponent to fear them. For example, Nina Williams is a trained assassin, Yoshimitsu is a robotic recreation of a ninja, and Marshall Law aims to set up a fighting school to pass on his knowledge.

As one of these eight figures, the player must come through fights in a 360-degree 3D environments with texture mapped backdrops and polygon graphics. After beating the seven rivals there are two bosses to beat. There are three difficulty levels, and fight lengths and number of rounds can be varied.

Each limb's movement is controlled with a different button, making finding the right combos a matter of instinct and planning rather than experimentation. Pure martial arts inspire most of the moves.

The 240p test suite is a homebrew software suite for video game consoles developed to help in the evaluation of upscalers, upscan converters and line doublers.

It has tests designed with the processing of 240p signals in mind, although when possible it includes other video modes and specific tests for them. These have been tested with video processors on real hardware and a variety of displays, including CRTs and Arcade monitors via RGB.

As a secondary target, the suite aims to provide tools for calibrating colors, black and white levels for specific console outputs and setups.

This is free software, with full source code available under the GPL.

To use the test suite download release from github and burn .cue/.bin to CD. There are 2 versions, one for real console which stop cd drive and second one for emulators which doesn't(I got black screen in some emulators). Both releases are fixed with cdmage because mkpsxiso from psxsdk doesn't generate image correctly which may cause problems for some emulators. You need to have modchiped psx or use swap method. To compile suite you need to install PSXSDK.

"Actua Soccer 3","","Region Not Set","","Gremlin Interactive Ltd.","Gremlin Interactive Ltd.","1998-12-04","2","No","Sports","","Actua Sports was a sports video game series published by Gremlin Interactive which competed with Electronic Arts EA Sports label during the second half of the 1990s, until Gremlin was acquired by Infogrames. The term ""Actua"" is a (seemingly marketing-related) play on Sega's line of ""Virtua"" titled games, which included Virtua Fighter, Virtua Racing and Virtua Striker.[1]

The first game in the series was the 1995 milestone title, Actua Soccer, which quickly became one of the most important titles for the company. It was later joined by the rebirth of the Premier Manager franchise and the club version of Actua Soccer. In 1996, the first non-football game was released, Actua Golf, followed by the sequels Actua Soccer 2 in 1997, now endorsed by English international Alan Shearer and Premier Manager 98. The third installement in the Actua Soccer series and the Ninety-Nine edition of Premier Manager followed in 1998, the year a new title debuted in the series: Actua Ice Hockey, the official video game of the Nagano Olympic Games ice hockey tournament, followed by Actua Tennis in the same year.

While the series died shortly after Gremlin was acquired by Infogrames, some of the games had further titles developed: UEFA Challenge, developed by the now Sheffield House, was published in 2002 and the rights of the Premier Manager franchise were acquired by Zoo Digital Publishing."

On Planet Celesta, a small world made from numerous islands, life is usually peaceful. However, when a small and mysterious island made of metal disappears, it's leader, Paziral, wreaks havoc on the Tonies' island, one of the most ancient on Celesta. And that's when one of the island's small inhabitants, Tiltilli, asks for your help.

A single-player adventure, Adiboo is your average platform adventure, but can be closely related with Naughty Dog's Crash Bandicoot series. There are two distinct playing styles that involve players in a 2D side-on scrolling platformer as well as a 3D adventure.

The side-on scrolling section of the game is very much an old school experience, whereby players move from left to right, jumping platforms and collecting numerous valuables. The 3D section is like many modern day adventures and includes boat races down lava streams.

And for a last generation PlayStation game, Adiboo looks quite respectable in the visuals department. Although pixelated, the game is reasonably smooth and for the most part, looks as good as any other PlayStation offering.

Adiboo and Paziral's Secret is a pretty good platform game for an old console. Great for the kids.

This game is also known as Adiboo and the Energy thieves on PC."

But this is not the only reason to be concerned about the detailed mission results: surviving units are transferred to the next mission and receive experience points. The campaign is also not completely linear, and the next mission depends on the result of the last - this means a lost scenario does not necessarily result in a game over, and a scarce victory can have devastating results.

The gameplay system remains largely unchanged in this sequel. Once again, Angelique has to use diplomacy to make the Nine Guardians lend her their powers (making the inhabitants of her land happy), or develop stronger feelings for her. New in this sequel is the ability to work with three different instructors, developing mind, sense, or dignity of the heroine, which will influence the way she interacts with other characters and also affect the behavior of the Guardians. 

""Angelique Special 2"" was originally released for the PC-FX and takes place after Angelique Limoges has become Queen and Rosalia, her aide. A new cosmos has sprung from the ashes of the one that collapsed in the first game and now they have to find a Queen for it. The candidates are Angelique Collet (brunette) and Rachel Hart. 

In this game, you choose between 3 different personality types (gentle, cheerful, strong-minded) and there are six new characters (three of which are your Instructors, Victor: mind, Sei-Lan: sense, Timka: dignity; Ernst replaces Pastha as head of the Royal Research Institute; Mel replaces Sara as the fortune-teller; Charlie is the mysterious merchant) besides the nine Guardians (which all sport new looks). Simultaneously with the ports to PS, SS, and Win95 there was a ""Premium Box"" version with a travel set theme and comes with a totebag, face towel, sewing kit, toothbrush set, and a special lunchbox-like container."

The game is played from a third-person perspective so to familiarize yourself with the controls, you can enroll in Boot Camp to run through an obstacle course, practice firing weapons, and work on combat skills.

To begin the single-player campaign, you'll receive objectives from General Grimm after which your character will appear in a combat zone. Use the map in the corner of the screen to help find your way to the current objective, carefully noting the type of terrain so you can plan your route of attack. But members of the Tan Army will try to thwart your progress every step of the way, so keep an eye on your health meter to know when to stop fighting and search for a Medkit. Also available on levels are Ammo Boxes (to replenish your standard-issue M-16), bazookas, flamethrowers, and sniper rifles. Since you can't replenish the ammo for the extra weapons, you'll have to take your shots carefully. The environments you'll battle in include real-world outdoor settings and indoor ""alternate world"" locales that include a giant bathroom, garden, sandbox, kitchen, and living room. Besides firing at everything that moves, Sarge can crawl on his belly, kneel, roll on the ground and climb ladders.

Commonly having neon or ultraviolet lights, extravagant paints, and shiny stainless or golden exterior parts, such decorations can be found on both on the exterior and the interior. Dekotora may be created by workers out of their work trucks for fun, or they may be designed by hobbyists for special events. They are sometimes also referred to as Art Trucks. 

1970s era: 
In 1975, Toei released the first entry in a series of 10 movies called Torakku Yaro (Truck Guys) that featured as the protagonist a trucker who drove his garishly decorated truck all over Japan. This movie was a big hit with both old and young, and caused a wave of dekotora popularity to sweep the country. While dekotora were present throughout the 1970s, before the movie they were restricted to the north-eastern fishing transport trucks. It is possible that the movie was an attempt to popularise these kinds of trucks. In those days, ready-made parts for trucks were not easily available, so these trucks freely utilised parts from sightseeing buses or US military vehicles. 

Modern times: 
Since the late 1990s, dekotora have been heavily influenced by the art of Gundam. In addition to the Gundam-influenced designs, it is common to see decorations that are more akin to modern art, or even retro designs that closely resemble those found in the movie Trucker Guys."

There are five different lakes in all, ranging from the murky Lunker Lake to the mountainous clarity of Crystal Lake. Each contains natural and manmade hazards (branches, poles, rocks) and different kind of fish--depending on the kind of fish you want, choose your lake accordingly.

For instance, the Silver Carp can only be found in dark, murky lakes or swamps and the Spotted Bass resides in the chilly, colder water areas. While the name of the game is bass, there are 14 different types of fish including the small but feisty Blue Gill, massively dynamic Carp, and the multiplying Rainbow Trout.

In addition to his or her game, the armchair fisherman will need to know how his fishing rod works and what lures to use on the various fish. There are fifty different tools in all ranging from Spinner Bait to the MHB-665 Bait Rod--one will want to know the functions of each lure and rig and choose an appropriate rod for the type of fish being hunted."

"Bastard!! Utsuro Naru Kamigami no Utsuwa","","Region Not Set","","","Opus Studio","1996-12-28","1","No","Role-Playing","","Bastard!! is a game based on the popular manga of the same name. You take on the role of Dark Schneider, an evil wizard who parts on a quest to regain back his memory. The gameplay isn’t really deep, you just go from one boss to another. You have tons of magic moves to use in battle and you can even combine them to create devastating spells. One major disadvantage is that the game was only aimed at the readers of the manga, so if you haven’t read the manga, you won’t understand anything of the characters and the background story. 

Bastard? Destructive God of Darkness is a manga by Kazushi Hagiwara. It first appeared in Weekly Shonen Jump, in 1988, and continues to be published irregularly today in Ultra Jump. Currently, it spans 25 volumes. 

In Bastard?, the Kingdom of Meta-Rikana is attacked by four armies. This prompts Dark Schneider, a wizard, to awaken within the body of 14-year old Lucian Lenren. 

Bastard?'s history is about sorcery, revenge, and other power struggles in a Dungeons & Dragons-like world. It is a dystopian world, where people need magic to survive against wild beasts, and evil monsters. There are endless rulers, each one with his own army of knights and mages, who fight for survival against those beasts and the armies of multiple evil sorcerers. 

In the anime, the six episodes tell of the awakening of Dark Schneider (also called Darsh or Darshu by those who know him well) and his subsequent attempts to destroy his old allies (The Four Lords of Havoc) and take over the world, whilst winning over multiple love interests. Dark Schneider had been imprisoned fifteen years earlier, trapped inside the body of Yoko's friend Lucien following a failed attempt to take over the world. In the meantime, his four generals attempted to resurrect the god Anthrasax, who would bring about an apocalypse and create the Sorcerer's Kingdom from the ashes of the old world. 

The story takes place in the future, a post-apocalyptic time following the release of Anthrasax at the height of Modern Civilization. Technology is gone and magic has asserted itself as a force in the world. Shortly after the fall of the modern world, demonic creatures began to appear en masse and forced humans to revert to a feudalistic, city-state based society. The episodes are rather disjointed, with scenes missing in between episodes making it hard to follow, but taken at face value it makes enough sense. 

Manufacturer's description: 

Hagiwara Hazime solstitial popular comic ""BASTARD!!"" based on an original story developed in RPG. And the battle system with a highly strategic position is reflected in the war situation and the compatibility of the character. Dark Schneider is working with the hero lost memory, to return to the real world back memories, let our adventure with friends.

Solo players can complete 40 search-and-destroy missions in the campaign mode, while up to two friends can blast each other to scrap metal in seven deathmatch, capture-the-flag, and tag variants. Twenty power-ups are available in total, ranging from cloaking and teleporting devices to plasma bolts and guided missiles. Featured levels take place in futuristic versions of San Francisco, Washington, London, Paris, and Berlin, all of which are home to ruthless, tank-driving gangs.

Prior to the game's beginning, Griffin Spade set about reclaiming his lost love and establishing his tribe in San Francisco. But the peace he'd blasted out for himself looks to be short-lived as he's having frequent nightmares about a sinister QueenLord. It's up to Griffin to mount up again and with all the finesse that a giant tank can muster and solve the mystery behind this evil woman. And so the stage is set for Battle Tanx: Global Assault."

In the former, players earn ten Bey Points (used to buy parts) and five Experience Points (used to level up) for each victory, but only five and three points respectively for a loss. Tournaments consist of seven rounds, including a semi-final and final round, with the ultimate winner being named champion and earning one of 30 Beyblade parts, while the vanquished receive 20 Bey Points as a consolation prize.

In Free Battle mode, players choose to battle with one of eight Beybladers from the television series. Two players can compete against each other, assuming one has data saved on a PS memory card. Three complete Beyblades can be saved at any given time, with customization of names, gender, and parts (exchange or buy). Beyblades consist of five main parts and a launcher, including a bit chip, attack ring, weight disk, spin gear, and blade base, and players can carry up to nine spare parts for repair or customization.

Battles require four points to win and features include special launches, shifting paths (based on the spinning top's parameters), special attacks, gimmicks (special powers inherent in some parts), and growth (to a maximum level of 19). Rewards are given for moving up levels, such as increases to endurance, mobility, attack power, and so forth. Throughout the battles, DJ Jazzman provides play-by-play in the Beystadium, Kenny offers help in customization, and Mr. Tate manages the parts shop."

"Big Air","","PAL","United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland","Accolade Europe Ltd.","Pitbull Syndicate","1999-03-01","2","No","Sports","E - Everyone","Accolade and Pitbull Syndicate have teamed up for Big Air, another take on the snowboarding genre that has you participating on thirty courses throughout six different countries including France, Japan, Scotland, Switzerland, the United States, and Germany. There are quite a few game play options in addition to the typical snowboarding fare including the World Tour, Training, One-Player and Two-Player modes.

Training mode is there for new players to get used to the various game play options and controls whereas the One-Player mode allows you to compete against another contestant in a series of competitions. Among the different game types include the Freeride Race, Freeride Trick, Half Pipe, Big Air, and Boardercross. The Freeride Race has you racing against an opponent for the best possible time; no points are awarded for performing tricks. Points are awarded, however, for tricks in the Freeride Trick mode. You're also graded on the race time remaining at the end of the competition.

While on the U-shaped Half Pipe, players are ranked on their ability to perform tricks and style. You'll want to keep momentum while performing tricks on this course as you'll earn points in regard to how difficult certain maneuvers are to pull off. The Big Air mode gives out points based on successful aerial tricks; the more impressive and difficult your moves are, the more points you'll earn! Boardercross is a race against multiple riders through courses that have everything from jumps and fierce turns to hazardous obstacles.

Combining all these different game types together is the World Tour mode. Spanning three difficulty brackets (easy, medium, and hard), your objective is to earn a number of points by winning competitions and meeting that division's boss character. On the Easy mode, you'll need a thousand points to elevate yourself to the next season; you'll be tested on random trickery events such as the Big Air and Half Pipe. By finishing each season, you'll not only move on to bigger and better (and harder) things, but also unlock various courses!

Finally, the Two-Player mode is a no-frills option for you and a fellow snowboarding enthusiast. You'll compete across a variety of courses and events for the ultimate title of Snowboarding King. Although you can perform tricks in any of the said events, points are only calculated on trick-based competitions. You can execute a multitude of flips, grabs, the impressive 180, and other dangerous maneuvers; let's see your friend try and out maneuver you!

Big Air also features over eighty realistically modeled snowboards and apparel from actual manufacturers including Palmer Snowboards, Ride Snowboards, Morrow Snowboards, Inc., Joyride Snowboards, Arbor Snowboards, Maui and Sons International, Burton Snowboards, Sessions, and Westbeach Apparel. The developers also included a blistering punk-filled sound track including Blink 182, Limp, Snuff, Diesel Boy, Leatherface, and The Odd Numbers.

An updated version, Resident Evil: Director's Cut, was released for PlayStation in September 1997, a year and a half after the original game. Director's Cut was produced to compensate for the highly publicized delay of the sequel, Resident Evil 2, and was originally bundled with a playable pre-release demo of that game. The Japanese version of the demo disc also included a pre-release demo of Rockman Neo, later retitled Rockman DASH (Mega Man Legends outside Japan), and a trailer for the newly released Breath of Fire III.
The main addition to Director's Cut is an ""arranged"" version of the game that changes the location of nearly every vital item in the mansion, as well as the enemy placement. The main characters, as well as Rebecca, are given a new wardrobe and the player's handgun is replaced by an improved model where any shot fired has a random chance of decapitating a zombie, killing it instantly. The original version of the game is included as well,[37] along with a new ""beginner"" mode where the enemies are easier to kill and the amount of ammunition that can be found by the player is doubled. Additionally, the auto-aim function was restored in all modes, though it is not noted in the in-game controls.
The North American and European releases of the Director's Cut were marketed as featuring the original, uncensored footage from the Japanese releases.[38] However, the full motion video (FMV) sequences were still censored, and Capcom claimed the omission was the result of a localization mistake made by the developers. The uncensored intro was later offered as a free download from their website.[39] The French and German PAL versions of Director's Cut do feature the uncensored intro FMV in color, though they lacked the uncensored Kenneth death scene. Although the PC version of Resident Evil was not billed as the director's cut version of the game, it is the only version of Resident Evil that has all of the uncensored FMVs, which includes the uncensored introduction, Kenneth's death scene in its entirety, and ending as well.

"Black/Matrix Cross","ブラックマトリクス+","NTSC-J","Japan","NEC Interchannel, Ltd.","Flight-Plan","2000-12-14","1","No","Role-Playing | Strategy","Not Rated","Black Matrix begins with a mute man being adopted by a woman who nurses him back to health from some traumatic experience. This differs from a Harlequin romance in several ways. There is the matter of the man having white wings and the woman having black wings: in this world black-winged people are dominant. The black-winged people also pay more than lip service to Satan. As expected in a world where Satan is omnipresent, love is a Bad Thing and once the woman admits to having feelings for the man, they are forcibly separated and the man meets up with allies in prison. Then a number of Biblical allusions are run through in the course of a battle against the oppressive forces of Satan (though figuring them out from the Japanese may take some effort).

Moving through the game will find the player thrust into a number of tactical battles, with the mute man (whose given name is Abel, incidentally) always being the leader. Tactical battling feels more like Final Fantasy Tactics than Shining Force, thanks to the isometric view and the lack of cut-scenes to show actions taken. Each character can move, attack, or use magic during a turn, with any two of these actions being permissible. The direction being faced does seem to affect damage done also.

Characters can be armed with a number of weapons; swords and axes are basic melee weapons, certain varieties of sword can hit diagonally around a character, archers strike from a distance, and spears pierce two squares away. Characters can strike friends as well as foes with equal impunity, though with the powerful enemies wandering about this is usually unwise. Magic operates rather like it does in many tactical RPGs - save for the Blood system."

But this time the game wasn't released outside Japan, there were originally plans for a PAL release but for some reason it never happened. 

Even though Blaze & Blade Busters uses the same engine as Eternal Quest it has some huge differences: 

- For example, there are some very interesting features on the start menu alone. You can do things that you cannot on Eternal Quest, such as renaming the items in your inventory to whatever you want and even battling friends in a duel. 

- Character creation is also interesting. When you have assigned your attribute points it adds them up and assigns you level based on how many points you have. So, you may start off at around level 50. The game will not only give you level 50 stats but it will also give you up to level 3 spells if you have chosen a sorcerer/priest/fairy, etc. 

- The game itself also plays very different. You begin at the Roadside Inn, but instead of walking around you have a menu on top of a loading screen that allows you to talk to different people, start a level, etc. 

- Another great feature is that you can buy items from the Expert for Gel. This gives a bit more of an incentive to collect money (the only reason for Gel in Eternal Quest was the auctions). 

The gameplay is your typical action RPG style. The game is also multitap compatible allowing up to 4 players to group together. There is big element of puzzle solving like any other action RPG, there is also an Object utility mode which allows players to buy and sell items they have found on their journeys with each other.

It was conceptualized by Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow, and influenced by the 1972 arcade game Pong, also by Atari. The game was ported to video game consoles and upgraded to video games such as Super Breakout. In addition, Breakout was the basis and inspiration for books, video games, film, and the Apple II personal computer.

In the game, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen. A ball travels across the screen, bouncing off the top and side walls of the screen. When a brick is hit, the ball bounces away and the brick is destroyed. The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen. To prevent this from happening, the player has a movable paddle to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play.

Block Wars is a mix between a classic breakout game and a strategy game.

There are 8 different characters for the player to choose.

3 different game modes:
- The story mode in which you will see a story with the character that you choose and will advance through it defeating the different opponentes.
- Tokoton Mode
- Vs Mode: Against another human player or against the computer.

The gameplay is not about destroying all the bricks as in the usual breakout games, since in this game the goal is to move the center line to your opponent, to do that you have to destroy the different line of bricks so the center line will move to your opponent, but being careful and quick or the opponent will move it to your side and you will lose.

"Blue Breaker: Egao no Yakusoku","Blue Breaker: Egao No Yakushoku","Region Not Set","","","Human Club","1997-12-27","1","No","Role-Playing","Not Rated","Blue Breaker Egao no Yakushoku is a ""love RPG"" - a sort of hybrid between an RPG and a dating game like Tokimeki Memorial. While you are playing the game, you will have to pay close attention to the level of how much the female characters like the main character. Blue Breaker proceeds in a nonlinear fashion, with Kain wandering from place to place seeing if anything happens. Almost every area in the game is accessible from the beginning; the only requirement is that Kain must move between wherever he currently is and however many locations are in the way. Each location is joined to another by means of a flat field. While moving through these flat fields Kain will experience enemies popping up randomly in front of him, eager to slay him if possible. Kain and companions will automatically battle the enemies. Kain's goal is not only to defeat the Dark Lord, but also to woo a bride. This is by far the more complicated aspect to Blue Breaker, with little being obvious in the game itself. There are certain guidelines however. If a woman interjects herself into Kain's party, forcing her out (which is possible) will negatively affect her feelings for Kain. Fighting is necessary, but fighting too much in one day will again negatively impress the ladies."

A fairy, claiming to be Crystal's guardian, tells Arys that the balance has been destroyed, and unless he can find and seal the Light Crystal to restore the balance, his world will be doomed. Arys must now set out into the world seeking the other guardians and the Light Crystal in order to save Sheena and his very world!

Brave Prove is a top-down action game much like The Legend of Zelda, but with a stronger emphasis on the RPG elements. As Arys defeats enemies, he gains experience and will level up, which brings increased abilities all around. He can also find many useful items including bombs, arrows, healing herbs, and a variety of equipment upgrades. Additionally, as Arys befriends each guardian, their elemental powers can be used to boost his sword attacks and provide various special abilities."

There are a total of ten planes to initially choose from (including WWII style fighters and stunt planes), all differing in speed, acceleration and mobility. The types of aircraft include a Lightning, Mustang, Thunderbolt, Corsair, Zero Fighter, Sinden, Messerschmitt, Spitfire, Geebee, Pitts and two hidden planes. Once you select your plane, you'll be able to freely choose any of the four courses to race on: Canyon, Snow Land, South City or Mountain. Watch for arrows or listen to the announcer signaling when you need to turn, dive or climb as you make your way through the course.

Play involves racing against the computer for three laps while trying to cross the finish line first. Find yourself lagging behind? Pick up red balloons with an ""S"" inside them for extra speed! After winning, you can then race on another course, choose a different plane, or try your hand at a Time Attack mode. Besides the one-player game, you'll be able to race against a second player on a horizontally-split screen. While the courses are not entirely open, those still having difficulty can choose an option to turn on blue spheres. These spheres will form a line helping players navigate the winding courses. Bravo Air Race also includes two camera angles for either a behind-the-plane or inside-the-cockpit perspective."

Initially released in Japan on September 11, 1997, the game was later released in North America and Europe in 1998. It is the first game in the franchise to feature three-dimensional graphics and voice acting. The title was developed by director Makoto Ikehara and features a unique jazz-inspired soundtrack by company composers Yoshino Aoki and Akari Kaida. On August 25, 2005, the game was ported and released for the PlayStation Portable handheld system in Japan, and was also released in Europe on February 3, 2006.

The story takes place in a fantasy world where humans live alongside anthropomorphic creatures, and centers the story on Ryu, the last of The Brood (a race of people who can transform into powerful dragons), as he searches the world to uncover the mystery of his people and reunite with his surrogate family. Ryu's journey takes him into adulthood where he is joined by a number of other characters who aid him in his quest. The game received mostly positive reviews upon release, and would go on to sell more than 679,000 copies in Japan and the United States.

On January 27, 2016, Capcom announced that Breath of Fire III would be re-released as a download in the US in February through the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation Vita, PSTV, and other PSP hardware compatible devices."

"Breeding Stud 2","","NTSC-J","","Konami","Konami","1970-01-01","1","No","Sports","Not Rated","Horse breeding is reproduction in horses, and particularly the human-directed process of selective breeding of animals, particularly purebred horses of a given breed. While feral and wild horses breed successfully without human assistance, planned matings can be used to produce specifically desired characteristics in domesticated horses. Furthermore, modern breeding management and technologies can increase the rate of conception, a healthy pregnancy, and successful foaling.

The male parent of a horse, a stallion, is commonly known as the sire and the female parent, the mare, is called the dam. Both are genetically important, as each parent provides half of the genetic makeup of the ensuing offspring, called a foal. (Contrary to popular misuse, the word ""colt"" refers to a young male horse only; ""filly"" is a young female.) Though many horse owners may simply breed a family mare to a local stallion in order to produce a companion animal, most professional breeders use selective breeding to produce individuals of a given phenotype, or breed. Alternatively, a breeder could, using individuals of differing phenotypes, create a new breed with specific characteristics.

Breeding Stud 2 is the sequel to Breeding Stud - Bokujou de aimashou and the second game in the Konami's horse breeding simulation game series in which the player is the owner of a ranch and he has to train his horses to win races and trophies that he can see in his trophy room.

In the game the player can buy new horses, decide which food they will have each week, talk with the different trainers, check the stables, take the horses to the races and all with a 3d graphics engine in the races and in the ranch. At the beginning of the game he can choose the clothes colour of his jockey.

The game features a movie player (the opening movie is the only one avaliable at the beginning of the game), and stadium views."

Now you (as George) are caught in the middle of a mystery that will have you traveling all over Europe to gather clues. Who set the bomb? Why? Are the authorities hiding something? The deeper you probe, the more complicated the story becomes. Broken Sword is an animated adventure that uses a point-and-click interface to perform all actions.

A cursor will change into various icons allowing you to do the following: talk with characters (the arrow switches to a mouth when positioned over an individual); examine objects (the arrow switches to a magnifying glass); use items (switches to gears); pick up objects to add to your inventory (grabbing hand); and exit the scene (a hand pointing to the left or right).

All of the characters you'll meet speak with recorded voices (and optional subtitles) while British composer Barrington Pheloung's musical score plays in the background. Players can also save their game at any time using one block of memory card space, or plug in the PlayStation mouse for easier navigation. Does the game sound familiar?

The main objective is to destroy or get rid of (by dropping) all the bubbles located within the stage. Once you do this, you'll graduate to the next level.

While the premise may sound simple, the logic and execution is not. Using a ""bubble shooter"", you must aim and shoot your bubbles to the top of the screen so that you can bring three bubbles of the same color together. When you do this, the bubbles will pop. One way to earn points is to have the popping bubbles as well as the bubble that was shot fall off the screen (in multi-player, it puts these bubbles on your opponent's side). This also gives you a lot less bubbles to take care of.

Bubbles are constantly falling down. Popping them all in a short amount of time is necessary because the longer it takes you to pop them all, the faster they will drop. If you fail to clear out all the bubbles and they reach the bottom of the screen, the game is over.

Bust-A-Move '99 contains some new options never seen in the Bust-A-Move series. There are now special bubbles (star, metal and rainbow to name a few), obstructive bubbles and blocks and new backgrounds. You are also given the opportunity to create your very own stages with the create-a-level editor."

The main character is a young U.S. intelligence officer, Lt. Ryan, who has been assigned to a British submarine, HMS Victoria, for a special mission. As the game begins, the submarine is fleeing the Antarctic after rescuing a Norwegian who has recently escaped from a secret German base in the Antarctic (it is later revealed that the base is built atop the Ancient Ruins mentioned in At the Mountains of Madness). Along with the Norwegian, the sub has picked up two mysterious cargo crates stolen from the Nazis.



The game involves solving puzzles through a point and click user interface. The player can examine any item and, depending on the item, either pick it up, use another item on it, or operate it in some way.
Some puzzles, if not completed within a short span of time (always less than a minute), will result in a game over. To ensure that the player does not get stuck by saving their game at a point from which they cannot possibly complete a puzzle in time, the game autosaves onto a separate save file at the beginning of each timed puzzle."

While Japanese gamers were graced with each compilation separately, Capcom Generations in Europe features no less than four compilations in one. These include Capcom Generations: Wings of Destiny, Capcom Generations: Chronicles of Arthur, Capcom Generations: The First Generation and Capcom Generations: Blazing Guns.

Capcom Generations: Wings of Destiny features 1942, 1943, and 1943 Kai. All three are vertical shooters where the player takes control of an aircraft in the thick of World War II combat. With an assortment of sea, land, and air enemies, as well as two-player options, new levels, power-ups and weapons in each title, Wings of Destiny aims to be the definitive vertical shooter compilation on the platform.

The second disc features Capcom Generations: Chronicles of Arthur, which retraces the steps of the classic Ghosts 'N Goblins platforming saga. Titles on this disc include Ghosts 'N Goblins, Ghouls 'N Ghosts and the Super NES release of Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts. All titles allow you to control Arthur, a knight who must fight the ghosts, ghouls, and goblins in order to rescue the princess. Each title is a side-scrolling action-platformer with new weapons, power-ups, magic, visuals, and levels.

Capcom Generations: The First Generation provides four of the first five titles Capcom ever released in the Arcades (1942 was the company's fourth release in December of 1984 but already appears on the first disc). Vertical shooting fans will welcome the inclusion of Vulgus, 1942's biggest influence and Capcom's first-ever Arcade title, and the lesser-known Exed Exes. Offbeat Japanese action is also delivered on this disc with Son Son and Higemaru.

The fourth disc, Capcom Generations: Blazing Guns, is for those into the character-based shooter classics. With Commando, Mercs (referred to as Commando 2), and Western shooting action in Gunsmoke, this disc is for the serious retro shooting fan. Apart from being able play all these classics on your PlayStation, Capcom has also gone one step further and provided artwork, tips, options, and more on every single disc."

This game is licensed and features many notable drivers from the late 1990s, such as Greg Moore, Al Unser Jr. and Paul Tracy. The game also features 10 authentic tracks as well as realistic handling and damage. Players can compete in a full year's worth of races competing for points in each race or in simple single races. There are two game modes: arcade and simulation. Arcade mode allows re-spawning of damaged vehicle parts. In Simulation mode, all damage is permanent for the race. The game supports the analog controller.

The play can make many modifications to a car's performance. The player can: adjust the tires to fit the road (hard for ovals or soft for road courses), as well as modify gear ratios and aerodynamics. Moving the front of the car down or slanting the wings may enable the player to find a perfect combination of speed and handling. During simulation mode races, the car's tires will wear down and fuel will deplete (both can be replaced by a pit stop).

In addition to the real drivers and cars (Honda and Ford included), ten official CART tracks have been included – each modeled after its real-life counterpart. Tracks span the United States and are located in Cleveland, Michigan, Long Beach and more. Each features realistic dynamics and road handling in an attempt to create a believable racing experience.

The parts the player starts with are supposed to be inferior to some of the ones you will get later on. As you win more races, you'll gain enough money to soup up your tiny car to be quick and agile.

Buying new parts for your car is part of the fun. There are more parts in this game than any other Choro Q game on the Playstaton. There are many different types of tires, like Racing, Semi-Racing, Off-Road, Water, Snow, and Big Tires (think Monster Trucks). There are lots of engines, transmissions and brakes, too. You can get spoilers, new chassises, and even horns and speedometers. There is a high degree of customization here."

The series incorporated many elements of RPG games including dungeon levels and quests for mystical objects. Soukaizan itself is represented as a series of tiered platforms each floating above the one beneath it in a rough pyramid shape. In order to progress to the next tier, the show's heroes must complete some task on the one beneath where he will meet the series' ultimate villain. In his quest to save the realm, he manages to transform a clay sculpture into a somewhat autonomous (small) Super Robot.

He also befriends many of the Soukaizan natives, and forms some very strong friendship bonds. The term Sou-kai-zan can be broken down to its 3 parts. Sou meaning creation. Kai meaning realm, space, world, or universe. Zan meaning hill or mountain. which is represented by the pyramid shape of the world's level."

The game starts with an animated sequence in which Cindy calls up her friends and invites them on a holiday in the Caribbean. This leads the player to the main menu. From this menu all the game's activities can be accessed. They consist of:

1) Adventures:
There are five adventures to choose from:
- Packing for the holidays: In this mini-game the player starts in Cindy's Room. A number of items of clothing are scattered around and the object of the game is to click on each to remove it from the screen within a fixed time limit. After clearing Cindy's room the player moves to Kate's room and then Diana's.

- Interior Designer: The player is presented with a picture of Cindy's Room and four icons. These icons change the style and colour of the sofa, the light, the picture and the chair.

- Lost Rabbits: This mini-game is similar to Whac-A-Mole. There are three levels to this game, all using the same tree-filled background. Behind some of the trees are rabbits which randomly slide into view before going back into hiding. The object of the game is to catch the rabbits by clicking on them. There is no time limit.

- Delicious Fruits: There are three levels to this mini-game, each featuring a different character against the same background. Each level lasts for a fixed period of time. Pictures of fruit and bugs fall slowly from the top of the screen and the object is to catch as much fruit as possible while avoiding the bugs. At the end of each level, and at the end of the game a score is given.

- Bikini Fun: In this game the player gets to change the clothes the girls wear. There is no option to save or print the picture

2) Cool tests:
There are four tests in this section:
- In the Boyfriend Finder the player answers questions about their favourite colour, shape and number then the computer calculates the name of the boys who would be a perfect match.

- The Coolest Girl test is very similar, after answering five simple multiple choice questions the game responds with an assessment of the players character.

- The Pet Guide asks questions about the players favourite food, flower and fruit before calculating the player's ideal pet.

- Finally the Friendship Indicator asks five multiple choice questions before responding with an assessment of whether the player would make a good friend or not.

3) Beach Images: This mini-game invites the player to select one of ten pictures. It then shows that picture full-screen in join-the-dots format. As the player must click on the dots in the correct order the game completes the picture line by line."

The story unwinds in an unusual manner: At the start of the game, your character, Agent John Cord, has been captured by the enemy and is in the midst of a grueling interrogation.

But tricky conundrums aren't the only thing blocking their paths -- they'll also have to take control of Agent Cord in high-octane gun battles against enemy agents.

To the Empire, expansion is of the utmost importance, even above famine, drought and death.

The League of Free Worlds exists to offer resistance and hope to the plundered outlying colonies. After a key victory, it is shown that the Empire's Navy can be harmed and the ranks of the League begin to swell.

Colony Wars is a combat fighter game set in space. You, as the player, join as a recruit in the League's fleet. Missions take place in various fighters, from a 1st person view inside the cockpit, or a 3rd person view from behind your ship. Ships have separate meters for shields and armor, and the player must cycle between weapons designed specifically to damage each. At the most basic, purple lasers must drain a target's shields, followed by switching to red lasers to destroy them.

The game features advanced lighting and particle effects for the Playstation, as well as a basic simulation of Newtonian physics. Thrusters are only active for as long as the accelerate button is held down. The player can burst fire their thrusters and drift, allowing for some advanced maneuvers. The campaign also features multiple endings and branching missions/storylines, based on your performance in the previous operations."

"Countdown Vampires","","Region Not Set","","Bandai Co., Ltd.","K2 LLC","2000-08-21","","No","Adventure | Horror","M - Mature 17+","Because Capcom's Resident Evil single-handedly created the modern survival horror genre, the critically acclaimed adventure spawned countless sequels and clones. Conceived by Bandai Digital Entertainment, Countdown Vampires is one of those clones -- you will maneuver 3D characters throughout 2D backgrounds in a series of fixed camera angles while fending off unspeakable horrors.

As a police officer, Keith J. Snyder has been assigned a security position at the grand opening of Desert Moon -- a hotel casino with a horror theme located in Casino City. While overseeing security and making sure VIPs aren't being hurt at the dance club, something goes horribly wrong. As a sudden fire causes sprinklers to go off, the water turns black and transforms the dancers into murderous vampire monsters. Assuming the role of the brave police detective, a civic servant and the last remaining human alive, Snyder must unravel the mysteries of the black water while defending himself against multiple monstrosities.

Armed initially with a tranquilizer gun, a shock glove and an unlimited supply of vampire-destroying white water, Keith J. Snyder will find and utilize twelve weapons and items throughout the course of his adventure. Also located throughout the hotel casino are computer terminals, maps of the area and vending machines in which helpful items are sold; at computer terminals, he can access an e-mail program that furthers the storyline.

In Countdown Vampires, Snyder's physical health is represented by a color-based condition gauge found in the inventory screen; green indicates a healthy body, yellow represents wounded and red coloring is fatal as Snyder approaches death. You can heal the character using various health items found throughout the casino. In addition to looking out for your character's health, you will solve various puzzles and seek out specific keys and cards for locked doors."

The mean Dr. Neo Cortex has kidnapped your bandicoot girlfriend for scientific purposes in a grand plot to take over the world. The nerve of some people is just unbelievable! Needless to say, your mission is to rescue your main squeeze by passing through three different islands filled with over thirty levels and ultimately destroying the evil doctor.

Gameplay is handled through linear 3D platforming, linear meaning each level has a distinctive path of completion with obstacles the player must overcome. Obstacles come in the way of various platforms, sandpits, and disappearing bridges. Some stages are played from a side-scrolling viewpoint while others are behind the bandicoot's back.

Sensing that Crash might be smarter than the average bandicoot, Cortex has created a veritable army of critters to hamper the hero's progress. There are many different enemies found within each level including turtles, penguins, man-eating plants, etc. In addition to basic enemies, there is a variety of mean-tempered boss characters. Ripper Roo is a genetically altered kangaroo with blade-like toenails, Papu Papu uses his size to strike fear into the hearts of men, and Pinstripe is a Tommy Gun-toting gangster.

Each level contains various pickups and hidden items found within crates/boxes. By collecting enough gems and keys, the player will be rewarded at the end of a level -- sometimes it's a bonus level, sometimes it's an extra life. Bonus rounds involve the bandicoot earning various fruit items and keys to unlock hidden levels. In order to unlock a bonus round, tokens must be collected throughout any given level. A Witch Doctor has also placed his mysterious masks throughout the islands to aid Crash in his quest.

Please help Crash Bandicoot rescue his girlfriend from the evil clutches of Dr. Neo Cortex -- she and the world are counting on you!"

Some move extremely swiftly but may only carry a hand pistol while others are a little slower off the mark but are packed with high-power weapons of destruction. 

- Versus Mode is your typical beat-em-up, one vs one, battle to the death. Taking place in an enclosed arena two of the selectable fighters enter into a gun battl. Scattered around each arena are a number of obstacles that may be used for cover therefore speed of movement becomes a great leveler. 

- Story Mode: You are allowed 99 seconds to complete each of numerous screens where there are several enemies to eliminated before the exit is revealed. Any obstacles standing in your way may be slowly destroyed by constant firing of your gun or taking the quick fix which involves lobbing a few of your limited grenades.

You can play against the computer or challenge a friend in head-to-head split-screen action. In the one-player mode, if you destroy the enemy tank, you win the round and advance to the next stage. If your tank loses all of its shield strength, the computer wins and the game is over. If you're playing with the timer on, the tank with the highest level of shield strength when the time runs out wins the battle.

In the two-player mode, the rules are similar with the notable exception that the first contestant with two battle victories wins the entire game.

Cyberbots is a very innovative game, attributed to its amount of selectable options, parts, and mecha that permit the player to format their play style to their preference. Similar to the Armored Core series, different legs (which affect movement abilities), arms (which affect reach and melee capabilities) and weapons can be mixed and matched between the selectable robots available to the player. Gameplay in Cyberbots is similar to other Capcom-created fighting games, with a medium-sized command list of executing various attacks available to each individual robot.

"Dancing Stage Fever","","PAL","","Konami","","2003-10-24","2","No","Music","E10+ - Everyone 10+","Dancing Stage Fever is a home video game in the Dancing Stage series, the European counterpart to Dance Dance Revolution. It was released in Europe and part of Asia in October 2003 by Konami, as part of its family-oriented 'Bemani' series. It was released in both a PlayStation 2 and a PlayStation version at the same time.

The latest addition to the popular series of dancing games, Dancing Stage Fever not only offers another welcome opportunity to get your dance mat hooked up to your PlayStation, but also throws in some new goodies to keep your feet moving that bit longer.

The crux of the game is the same as always. In time with the directions on screen, you need to make sure your foot hits the appropriate symbol at the right time. The more accurate you are, the better you will do. You can still play the game with a standard control pad, incidentally, but it's a fruitless exercise, especially when you consider just how cheap a dance mat is.

New this time round (although when you're in the midst of a dance it's harder to appreciate it) is the inclusion of officially licensed music videos (PS2 version only). It's a nice addition, but of more interest is the roster of new songs, including tracks from the Spice Girls, Madness and numerous 80s artists. There are plenty of songs to dance to, which is what it's all about.

Anyone who has enjoyed a Dancing Stage game to date is going to find few faults here. It hardly changes the formula of the genre, but then it doesn't need to. It provides a fresh dose of high-entertainment dancing fun, even if your feet will hurt by the time you've finished."

Rather than a game that just requires you to try and win the race, this game gives you points to destroy the other racers' cars. The game has many styles of game play so you don't have to play the same style each game.

There are 5 game styles in the Single Race section of the game. This section does not count towards unlocking cars or tracks. It is for practice and just plain fun. The main style is Demolition.

In Demolition, you race against other cars around the track and get points for hitting them, spinning them in circles and knocking them into the wall. You also get a big bonus for landing on top of a car which will immediately destroy the car. When you finish the race, your final position is found by multiplying the points you got from hitting the other cars with the points that you got for the position you finished in. So if you finish first, but never hit anyone, you won't win the race."

This is great if you want a tiny ship to balloon in size. Ships can be on the ground (background) or in the air (foreground), invincible or harmless, whatever you choose. You can also compose all the music.

Dezaemon Plus is a vertical shooter divided in two main areas. You start a level with your basic shooting mechanics and as you progress through the level you get some power-ups to help you beat the boss, in order to get to the next level. As simple as gameplay is, it becomes a little hard because your ship is usually too slow and the increasing amount of enemy fire makes it difficult to handle, let alone getting the power-ups that make the game significantly easier."

Dino Crisis is very similar in both control and gameplay to its sister series, Resident Evil.

Unlike Resident Evil games, Regina will find very few actual supplies laying around, and will instead find ""plugs"" that are used to open caches of emergency supplies located around the complex. There are only enough plugs to open some of these caches, however, so care must be taken to decide what items are really needed. In another change from Resident Evil, the game is rendered in 3D, allowing the camera to rotate or pan, although camera angles are still out of the control of the player. Even the dumbest dinosaur is smarter than the undead, and enemies can chase and disarm Regina, and even occasionally follow her through doors."

Unique in the game were the special ki attacks called a Special Knockout Trick. These were the spectacular versions of the character's ki attacks the player performed at a distance. When these attacks are performed, the camera would cut and pan to the attacking character who would power up and the player would fire. During the attacking character's power up, the opposing character would be giving the opportunity to either retaliate or block upon the moment the word counter would flash on the lower right hand corner of the screen. If the player chose to retaliate, they too would power up and fire a ki attack causing a power crossfire which the camera would go around both characters à la bullet time.[1] Which player is pressing their button the fastest determines who receives the brunt of the blast.

Driver 2 offers a few additional features.

Your job includes setting out strategies, planning training sessions, keeping an eye on your players and attracting new talent, taking care of finances, and of course making sure that you win your matches. You will be given specific goals, such as qualifying for the champion's league, or defending the club's reputation. Games do not only include league matches, but friendlies and cup matches as well.

The actual games can be watched real-time in 3D, allowing for on-the-fly substitutions and tactical decisions, and a unique feature is you can both manage and play for a club, although there is no way to actually control players or actively participate. All players have different abilities and characteristics, which can be trained to create a well-balanced team. The French version portrays manager Guy Roux (famous of Auxerre), while the UK version has Alex Ferguson (Manchester United).

On top of an all-new game engine, over 50 major changes and new features are being programmed into Alex Ferguson's Player Manager 2001 to enhance the menu system, speed up the pace and accessibility of in-game options and offer a totally realistic feel to that build up of tension to match day.

Over 122 new player motion captures, new player models and dynamics and stadium environments will deliver true-to-life representations of player tactics as each game is played in real-time, while enhanced post-match statistics will give an at-a-glance guide to how well those tactics worked.

An all-new set-piece designer, three different match modes, full kit design facility and vastly improved tactics designer will also guarantee PlayStation Managers will be fiddling and tweaking their joypads for months to come.

""Player Manager gives a real insight into what management is all about,"" commented Ferguson.

A new control system, making full use of the PlayStation controller, means all menus and game areas are easily accessible, while fully updated clubs and kits for season 2000-2001 and a wider allocation of foreign players available on the transfer market look set to make Alex Ferguson's Player Manager 2001 the most comprehensive football management sim on the market.

Al these innovative features have been topped off with unique game content input and an in-game end of season evaluation as a Player Manager from Ferguson himself."

Throughout the planet of Arrakis (a desert-like planet riddled with dunes and sand), three military powers have engaged in a fierce war to control a most prized resource known as the Spice Melange. The mysterious spice can only be found on the planet of Arrakis; every race in the known universe lusts for its power.

With all the bickering and fighting over Spice Melange, the Emperor has issued a challenge that basically states whoever controls the substance will control Arrakis. The three aforementioned forces include the noble House Atreides, the wicked House Harkonnen, and the enigmatic House Ordos. Not only does each house desire control, they also have different reasons for entering the war.

The House Atreides loathes and fears the evil forces of the Harkonnen and wishes to form an alliance with the Fremen, strange sand-dwelling warriors that inhabit the bowels of the planet. The nobles function much like a normal army, giving commands for the side of good. On the other hand, House Harkonnen is run by a tyrannical baron that demands victory. These blood-drinking savages enjoy battles and chaos more than the actual victory; they reign with widespread fear. House Ordos is a bit more unorthodox than their warring brethren. Led by cyborg-like officers, they go into battle with a strategic mentality and play for the odds. Gut feelings aren't acceptable in their society. Having arrived with Lady Alara on the desertous Arrakis, she has enlisted you as a commander of one of the three military powers. Her sisterhood is hoping that you will be victorious with that house above all others, as to create a clear faction in control of the Spice Melange in which her Order could form an alliance.

After selecting the house of your liking, a commander will give you a military briefing and objective. As a 3D real-time strategy game, you'll begin by constructing a series of battle units, important housing structures (walls, construction yards, barracks, outposts) and vehicles; this is vital in order to meet the mission objective. You'll start the scenario with a power supply for building a Spice Melange refinery to generate money. Afterwards, it's up to you to build a fully operational base. Upon completion of the necessary structures, it's time to attack your opposition! You'll command and control a wide variety of light infantry soldiers, troopers, saboteurs, and the aforementioned Fremen.

Dune 2000 also supports the Dual Shock Analog Controller for analog movements and the vibration function. It also comes with mouse support. You can utilize any PlayStation memory card for saving game data and options."

The most notable change in Supercross is that EA opted to go with a more arcade-styled control scheme this time around. While this may come as a disappointment to gamers looking for the ultimate motocross sim, fact of the matter is, they tried the more realistic approach in the last game and it did not work well.

While reaching for his beloved donuts, he accidently spilled coffee on his work station at the MomSteel Steel Factory. Now the machinery has taken on a life of its own! Assume control of Charlie the Egg in your effort to find the reset switch located somewhere within the factory. The game consists of 43 pre-rendered levels and 12 boss characters, all of which are various forms of machinery, from Blast Furnace Bill to Rotato the Repair Robot.

In order to clear a level, Charlie must locate a certain number of time clocks and hit them with his wrench. To reach the clocks, he'll need to walk across narrow ledges, spinning gears, and past open flames. Besides using the wrench, Charlie can also jump, throw bolts and roll away. Items to look out for are paper airplanes (they'll give you information or clues), donuts to replenish any damage, coins to give you extra lives and fans to cool you down. After all, moving through a hot steel factory can be especially dangerous to an egg. The game automatically saves your progress to memory card, so keep moving and save that factory!

The most notable feature of the game is the number of impressive CG cinemas that play constantly throughout your adventure. If you fall off an edge, you'll see Charlie do a Humpty Dumpty impression, and if you make it to the next level by punching the last time clock, a transition scene will play."

In 2242, war breaks out again - the Earth slowly begins to win... except for the efforts of an experimental Selene technology known as Einhänders: flying machines with a ""hand"" that allows them to change weaponry mid-battle.

The atmosphere of the game is very ""industrial"", down to the German industrial music playing in the background (think Einsturzende Neubauten mixed with Lords of Acid).

Those five guys are extremely ugly and can contaminate you with an awful disease the moment they touch you. So you should outsmart them and run away before they can catch you. The gameplay is turn-based. You enter a room with the Oops Five monsters, and move in different directions, trying to avoid collision.

The catch is that each monster has his own movement style. One of them will always imitate Sunzuki and move into the same direction as he; another will, on the contrary, move into the opposite direction, etc. By planning ahead, you must be smart enough to make your moves correctly and make it to the exit before Oops Five get you."

It was originally released for the Nintendo 64 in October 1998. An adaption of the game for Game Boy Color was developed by Tarantula Studios and released in 1999. A PlayStation port, developed by Runecraft, was released in 2000, under the name Evo's Space Adventures. Players control Evo, a robot reduced to a crawling microchip after a ship crash, and are tasked with taking control of animals to solve puzzles and defeat enemies.

The game began development in September 1995, as part of a publishing deal with BMG Interactive. When this deal fell through, the development team turned their focus to the Nintendo 64, which allowed for a more advanced environment and model processing. The hardware also shaped the game's humour and style, with a soft focus look leading to a style akin to Plasticine models. The game's distinct British humour was also used to distinguish it from other games. Similarly, the game's music was created to resemble B movies.

Upon release, Space Station Silicon Valley was acclaimed by many reviewers, with praise particularly directed at the intuitive mechanics, innovative level design, and comical concepts. It won numerous awards, including Game of the Month and Most Innovative Game from IGN. Despite this, the game performed poorly commercially, and was unable to secure enough sales to warrant a sequel."

The game features over 40 national sides, fully integrated seasons, set piece selections, increased physical contact, new facial animations, shielding ability and tougher tackling.

The game received mixed reviews due to its cartoonish graphic engine and shallow gameplay, a brand new engine was implemented in an attempt to give more ""emotion"" to the 3d player models. The game was generally considered to be much inferior than its rival.

The opening video for FIFA 2000 features Sol Campbell performing motion capture duties for the game, then having his likeness computer-generated to play against a retro side from 1994 - the year of the inauguration of FIFA. The game also included Port Vale, the club supported by Williams, in the ""Rest of the World"" section (they were in Football League 1 at the time, and while the concept of post-season promotion and relegation was introduced in this edition, teams from lower league tiers were only selectable starting with FIFA 2004)."

FIFA 2002 is the ninth game in the FIFA series.

Power bars for passes were introduced, and dribbling reduced in order to attain a higher challenge level. The power bar can also be customised to suit the gamer's preference. The game also includes club emblems for many more European clubs as well as for major Dutch clubs such as PSV, AFC Ajax and Feyenoord, although there was no Dutch league of any kind (they were under the ""Rest of World"" header). This game also features, for the first time, the Swiss Super League, at the cost of excluding the Greek League. A card reward system licensed from Panini was also introduced where, after winning a particular competition, a star player card is unlocked. There is also a bonus game with the nations that had automatically qualified for the 2002 World Cup (France, Japan and South Korea), in which the player tries to improve the FIFA ranking of their chosen team by participating in international friendlies.

It features all 28 National Hockey League teams in addition to 18 international clubs. Because it comes with full NHL and NHLPA licensing, the developers were able to incorporate actual hockey stars, players, and statistics into the game based on the 1999/00 season!

Since NHL Championship 2000 was developed under FOX Sports' watchful eye, there are a few odds and ends that the television company has included. Most notable is the FOX TRAX technology; this gadget allows players to see passes and shot opportunities via a streaking red-comet line that follows the puck. Fighting has also been made possible! If a certain player is giving your team beef, sacrifice some time in the penalty box and unleash an uppercut or a rabbit punch!

There are a variety of gameplay options including the Head-to-Head Exhibition, Season, Playoffs, and World Tournament modes. The Head-to-Head Exhibition game is a simple game of hockey with a computer-controlled or human opponent. Because winning or losing has no effect on the team, this mode is a great way to learn controls and the rules of hockey.

The Playoffs mode simulates the post-season tournament for the coveted Stanley Cup. This saves you the time and hassle of taking a team through an actual NHL season. If you'd rather play through an entire or shortened season, you have the option! The Season mode is everything a hockey enthusiast could want; players are given complete control over the team including formations, substitutions, trading and creating players, signing free agents, and other managerial agendas! Additionally, the World Tournament is a ladder-based competition between any and all teams that sign up.

NHL Championship 2000 also features real-time commentary from John Davidson and Kenny Albert. Not only will they call the action play-by-play, but they'll offer up a pre and post-game analysis of players, statistics, or extraordinary shots. Additionally, players can select a variety of options including strictness of referees and period length."

"GaiaSeed: Project Seed Trap","","Region Not Set","","","Techno Soleil","1996-12-13","1","No","Action | Shooter","Not Rated","Gaia Seed is a horizontally scrolling shooter from Techno Soleil. The game comes from the fabulous line of classically-styled Japanese shoot 'em ups, bursting at the seams with parallax scrolling, screen-filling bosses and other classic effects that you could count on from the games of this era. But the real beauty of GaiaSeed lies in its subtlety. The game has tight control, precise bullet collision, and a simple powerup system, while the haunting soundtrack stands out for its techno/ambiance mood, adding to the subliminal nature of the work.

You have a single ship choice and three difficulties. Gaming veterans will want to start on HARD, which differs only slightly if at all from NORMAL, and isn't particularly challenging anyway. You get two extra credits in NORMAL, for a total of 5, which is ample if you want to credit feed your way to the best ending. No one should touch EASY, since it limits you to reaching Stage 4. There are 7 stages with 3 possible endings, none of which are affected by credit usage.

Power-ups consist of 2 main shots (RED and BLUE), 2 sub-weapons (YELLOW and GREEN), and an eIntense Shot' based on your main weapon which basically acts like a Power Bomb. Main weapons stack up to 3 times (RED: starts on 1 shot then 2, 3 and finally 4 shots), sub-weapons don't stack. Lose a ship and you lose your sub-weapon, while your main weapon goes down one level.

BLUE is the Laser Shot, a straight line weapon with strong frontal attack which increases in thickness and power as you stack it. The laser's eintense shot' is a massive sausage of light cutting across the screen and wiping out all in its path. RED is Needle Shot. This is your typical V-shot weapon. Less powerful than BLUE, but when stacked 3 times has a wide ranging spread. The intense shot is a series of blue homing orbs target enemies and weak points on bosses, making this the best main weapon. GREEN is the Cipher Wave, the best sub-weapon since it fires four blobs which home in on enemies and can attack craft which are behind you, which is essential during boss fights. YELLOW is the Energy Blaster and acts like an additional V-shot weapon. Absolute rubbish.

With such a simple weapons set most players will opt for a RED and GREEN combo for the game's duration. Which isn't a criticism. Gaia Seed doesn't distract you with superfluity; it's functional, with a focus on dodging and shooting. What's especially cool, and sets it apart from other shmups, is that both your health bar and Intense Shot bar are continuously recharging. This effectively gives you infinitely spawning power bombs and infinite health - but it doesn't break the game's balancing.

Enemies frequently use screen-filling beam-based draining weapons, forcing you to let off a volley of shots and then scramble out of the beam's attack before your life is fully drained. With bosses this creates some intense battles of endurance - especially if you're trying to beat them by letting the timer run down (those are some pretty intense 120 seconds). After escaping a draining blast you can lick your wounds at the screen's edge, healing while avoiding bullet patterns. The patterns are fairly busy but without ever reaching danmaku levels of weaving. A slight comparison could be made to Deep Blue on the PC Engine, which had a recharging health bar and encouraged enemy avoidance (as pointed out by Mag Weasel).

A mention must go to Gaia Seed's timed bosses. Defeating them by letting the timer reach zero doesn't do much during the main game apart from giving you a sense of accomplishment, but if you want to see the best ending you'll let the two final Stage 7 bosses' live.

Visually almost everything is sprite based, though it varies in terms of quality. The first stage contains hundreds of massive though pixelated objects moving around, while the second has some interesting Mode 7 styled screen rotation effects. Stage 3 contains some decent parallax scrolling, though not as good as in Thunder Force IV. Subsequent levels are reasonable but without flair.

The stand out element of Gaia Seed though has to be its soundtrack, which almost warrants download alone. It's extremely unconventional, being a blend of ambient music with chanting, classical music, hip-hop and thumping techno. Stage 2's track almost sounds as if it's been taken from Panzer Dragoon Saga. It's eclectic, strange, and very good. The sole composer was Xacs Ishikawa, also known as Naoto Ishikawa, a fairly obscure composer connected to works like Psyvariar and Touhou. Interestingly, he also collaborated with Harumi Shiina to remix Koji Endo's King's Field soundtrack, to create an album called Invitation to the Graveyard ~ King's Field I Arrange Collection."

It is late in the 22nd century, and the insect-like Galaga are back. Humans have terraformed and colonized most habitable places in our solar system, but the Galaga have only one thing in mind: destruction. The Galaga are mutated nanites that were inadvertently created during the terraforming process. They are deadly, autonomous and great in number, and you must blast them into oblivion. In addition to shooting Galaga, you must perform various mission objectives, such as collecting life pods and activating water turbines.

Like in the original game, you begin this enhanced version of Galaga controlling a ship that moves horizontally along the bottom of the playfield and fires upward at wave after wave of diving, swirling aliens that eventually fly into formation. However, unlike the original, this game, depending on what mission you are playing, features a number of other viewpoints, including over the shoulder, top down and side on. You can fire just two shots at a time, but you can gain the ability to have three shots onscreen at once.

Also like the original game, GALAGA -- Destination: Earth features challenge waves in which you blast streams of enemies for points while not having to worry about your own safety. And, of course, you can let a Galaga capture your ship, then shoot your ship's captor, letting the captured ship fall to you, enabling you to double your firepower. Similar to Gaplus, the sequel to classic Galaga, this game also lets you collect beam power-ups that enable you to capture enemies, place them by your side and use their weapons."

In a similar vein to Atari's 1983 Star Wars arcade game, the computer is actually flying the ship, and the players are simply gunners given plenty to shoot at. In addition to bringing home the coin-op's ""Project Dragoon"" scenario, another entire mission, ""The Rising Of Gourb,"" is also included. 

This mission allows players to follow up their recent rescue of the Earth with a desperate mission to save another world from the alien menace. Galaxian3 has little or no connection to Namco's Galaxian coin-op classic, and the PlayStation edition is only available as a Japanese import, despite the fact that it did make it to some U.S. arcades. 

Inspired by the ""walk-in"" theatrical-style arcade game, Galaxian3 is a blast-fest for up to four players. While the computer does the flying in this first-person shooter, the players are trigger-happy gunners with plenty of alien ships crowding the sky as targets. Everything, from stationary gun platforms on enormous alien command ships to agile fighters, is fair game. Occasionally reactors and other strategic targets must be hit, including one sequence that bears a bit of resemblance to a certain chase through a certain Death Star. 

The complete arcade game is included, along with an original second ""mission"" involving an alien planet that must be saved."

A villain named Ecorori kidnaps Omitsu, and it's up to Goemon and his crew to stop him.

The game is extremely similar to Ganbare Goemon 2 for Super Famicom and Goemon's Great Adventure/Mystical Ninja 2 in that there's mostly sidescrolling levels, accompanied by some Impact bosses. Unlike previous Goemon games, which have used sprites or 3-D models for the characters, the characters are now represented by pre-rendered CGI, giving them a quasi-3-D look. Also, Yae is featured in her outfit that first appeared in Mononoke Suguroku."

One night, Goemon awakens from his sleep to some huge noise, so he and Ebisumaru decide to go and investigate. The pair find out that it's an alien, and that Edo's being invaded!

This is the first Goemon game since Sasuke and Yae's appearance as playable characters that doesn't include either on the playable roster. Instead, they are replaced by the new characters Goroku and Baban. Although Sasuke and Yae are playable characters again in most future games and Goroku and Baban are never seen, mentioned or heard from again after this game. Its unknown why they never appear again, but it is assumed that many fans were upset over Sasuke and Yae being replaced.

Gameplay is rather similar to Ganbare Goemon 3, as there's a main map in top-down perspective, which leads to various 2-D sidescrolling levels."

"Gate Keepers","","NTSC-J","Japan","Kadokawa Shoten","Kadokawa Shoten","1998-12-16","1","No","Adventure | Strategy","Not Rated","Gate Keepers is a Japanese manga series written by Hiroshi Yamaguchi and drawn by Keiji Gotoh in 1999. The manga was adapted into anime series produced by Gonzo, and first aired on April 3, 2000. The series was also produced into a role-playing game for PlayStation.

A six episode OVA sequel Gate Keepers 21, was released in 2002. The main characters in the OVA sequel were the next generation of Gate Keepers.

All incarnations of the titled ""Gate Keepers"" series, follow the same basic premise and share most of their characters, with some major discrepancies (mainly involving the character Reiji Kageyama). A character from the game, Francine Allumage is completely absent from the anime. Another character from the game Misao Sakamori, was replaced in the anime with the new original character Megumi Kurogane (though Misao does make a guest appearance towards the end of the anime).

The story is set in 1969, a period of time in which Japan is experiencing intense economic and social development after the end of World War II in 1945. Unbeknownst to humans, alien/interdimensional beings have emerged with plans to take over the world by sending numerous agents to wreak havoc in cities, turning people into robotic minions. They are referred to as ""Invaders"".

In an attempt to confront the Invaders and defend the planet; an elite but highly secret organization of peace-keepers called the Alien Exterminating Global Intercept System (more commonly known as A.E.G.I.S.), was set up with special funding from the government. They rely on the ability of ""Gate Keepers"", who have the power to open dimensional ""gates"" of a paranormal energy that give them their superpowers. These superpowers are the only weapons that have any effect on Invaders.

Although A.E.G.I.S. has branches around the world, the series focuses on the Far East division in Japan. The headquarters of the Far East branch of A.E.G.I.S. lies beneath Tategami High School, a facade created by the organization to mask the active recruitment of new Gate Keepers. Since many of the candidates were High School students, the location allowed the agents to be enrolled in school and be available for a mission at a moment's notice."

An overhead perspective allowed players the freedom to explore the maze-like levels while still being able to see everything around them.

The object of each stage was simply to destroy the monsters in your path as you searched for the exit leading to the next level. Gauntlet Legends takes this simple formula and adds a new story, distinct worlds and even boss characters to fight. Of course, there are still treasure and potions waiting to be found as well as various traps that could spell disaster for even the heartiest of warriors.

In order to help you survive the later levels (Gauntlet Legends consists of over 30 stages), characters can earn experience points that will eventually translate into added strength, speed, armor and health. The story behind the game involves a jealous brother (Garm) of a noble wizard (Sumner) who decided to gather 13 Rune Stones in order to raise a demon.

Once the stones were placed on the floor of Sumner's tower, a hideous monster named Skorn was awakened and promptly consumed its new ""master."" As one of four intrepid adventurers, your goal is to travel through the worlds making up the Gauntlet Legends universe to defeat the evil demon Skorne and his various followers (a rather unsavory lot of Grunts, Ankle Biters, Suiciders, Bomb Throwers and Death).

To help you fight the good fight, you'll be able to find food, special weapons and power icons that can all be stored in your inventory and used whenever your character needs them. Some of the weapons include a three-way shot, fire breath and super shot, while the power-ups include super speed, invisibility and Anti-Death Power (which allows you to steal health from the normally invulnerable Death)."

You assume the role of a young boy whose father, Teo McDohl, is a distinguished general in the Scarlet Moon Empire. The hero of the story, your character, is coming of age and going through trials and tribulations about being the son of a decorated general. 

After Teo left to head up north for official business, it was up to your character to take care of everything in his absence. The hero joins the Imperial Guard but then realizes things aren't as they seem -- very shady dealings and characters. In a rebellious fashion, you take heed under a woman named Odessa and join the Liberation Army, a group of ragtag individuals who are adamant about overthrowing the Imperial Guard. 

In Suikoden, you are presented with a vast world to explore and lots of mysteries to solve and fighting to do. As you journey around to various towns, you will come across adventurers who want to join the fight. There are 108 total companions (the Stars of Destiny) to find and recruit, though you can only have a handful in your party at one time. Some are actually needed to progress throughout the game, and some are there for the sake of being there -- for the cause at hand. 

You will also come across 27 Runes of Truth, mysterious stones that give the wielder great power and ability. Among the various runes is the Killer Rune that doubles your chances of executing a critical blow; the Hate Rune shoots off a searing fire projectile; and the Dragon Rune allows dragons to coexist with humans. Each one is almost essential to find. 

In addition to regular party battles (against a collection of nasty monsters and enemies), you'll engage in one-on-one duels and full-scale wars, a struggle against the Liberation Army and the Imperial Guard. When fighting in one of these battles, every single Star of Destiny you have found so far will come out and fight for you. Each character is then grouped together and when they have attacked, they sit the rest of the battle out until the end of the turn. It plays in this fashion until either the Liberation Army or Imperial Guard is defeated."

Tired of his tyranny and oppression, a woman named Odessa Silverburg rose up and formed a revolution to end Barbarosa's evil reign. Son to one of Barbarosa's generals, Teo McDohl, joined with Odessa and headed up the Liberation Army. Together they gathered recruits to amass the 108 stars of destiny and overthrew Barbarosa. They forged a land of unity and peace and for the time everything was calm.

Such was the setting for Konami's sleeper RPG triumph, Suikoden. Now, three years after the fall of Barbarosa, a new war threatens the peaceful land. The Highland Empire, ruled by the Blight family, has instigated a war with the peaceful city-state Jowston. After much fighting a peace agreement is finally formed between the two sides. The main character and his childhood friend, Jowy, are soldiers in the war and are sent to oversee the treaty talks. Overjoyed by talks of the end of the war, all the two can think about is finally returning to their hometown, Kyaro. But something goes terribly wrong and the two are cast off, branded traitors to their country. After being exposed to treachery, power, greed, everything that come with war, the two must struggle with their own destined path. You must once again bring together the 108 stars of destiny and put an end to the war.

And so begins the epic saga that is Suikoden II, the next episode in Konami's amazing Suikoden series. New features to the game not found in the original include: New tactical, turn based war battles which offers total control, upgraded graphics and new special effects on spells and animations, 108 characters to help you in your quest, each with a different ability and purpose, the option to use your Suikoden data from the first game to unlock hidden storylines and an improved and unique ""castle building system"" exclusive to Suikoden.

CHARACTERS:
The protagonist of Suikoden II (whose name is decided by the player at the start of the game) goes from being a member of a youth brigade in the Highland Kingdom to being the leader of its opposition, the New Alliance Army. In acquiring one half of the Rune of the Beginning, he is destined to become leader of the newly rebuilt Jowston Army, and also to oppose the holder of the other half of the Rune of the Beginning, Jowy Atreides.

The antagonist for the majority of the game is Luca Blight, heir to the throne of Highland. Luca is a bloodthirsty madman who developed a strong hatred for Jowston at a young age after witnessing his mother's rape by thugs hired by City-State capital Muse to attack the Highland royal envoy.

A variety of characters from the original Suikoden appear in Suikoden II. Some such as Viktor play major roles in the story, while others only appear in cameos (such as Kage who is briefly seen talking to Jowy before Mayor Anabelle is killed). If the player has a completed save data from the original Suikoden in their memory card, then the protagonist of the previous game's can be recruited and Gremio will appear briefly (if the saved game did not have all 108 characters recruited, Gremio will not appear). List of recurring characters in Suikoden has a comprehensive list of all characters who span multiple parts of the series."

The game was first released in July 1997, along with soundtrack albums, an artbook and a guidebook.

The game's story and art design were written and illustrated by Masamune Shirow, the author of the original manga. Ghost in the Shell's plot revolves around a recruit of Public Security Section 9 as he investigates and combats the Human Liberation Front. The player controls a Fuchikoma, a robotic fighting vehicle capable of traversing walls and ceilings.

The game received mainly positive reviews. It was praised for its graphics, animation, music and unusual wall-climbing mechanics. However, it received criticism for its tedious and repetitive gameplay and low difficulty.

Players are greeted with two options -- a friendly match and the tournament. The former is simply a single game against a friend or the computer. In both modes, players have the option to choose from 70 actual international teams complete with real rosters.

The real meat and potatoes lies within the tournament aspect. Once a team has been selected, the objective is to guide them to the World Cup -- the supreme objective in soccer. After a team plays three matches, the knock-out tournament begins. Weaker teams that are prone to losing are then dropped from the tournament as the quarterfinals begin.

Tournaments are played just like the real thing -- commit an offense and you'll be penalized! The game uses official and up-to-date rulings (circa 1999) for international soccer. Like Electronics Arts says, ""If it's in the game, it's in the game"" -- Alexi Lalas Soccer features a wide variety of goal kicks, back-passes, slides, shin hits, etc.

In order to achieve the World Cup, it will be up to the player to manage his or her team successfully. To do this, you'll need to set up strategies depending on the team you're playing, initiate player substitutions and keep your eye focused on the gameplay. On each given team, you have the option of comparing each player in skill -- this becomes very useful for setting up squad formations (28 in all). Depending on your players' skills, you may want to set up a squad for attacking and a squad for defense. How you choose to do it is entirely up to you!

Alexi Lalas International Soccer comes equipped with over 250 motion captured soccer actions courtesy of Eric Wynalds who coincidentally is on the United States team with Alexi Lalas. Additionally, it combines high-resolution graphics with a variety of different camera angles (six in all). There is also an option to play the game in Spanish."

Stealing cars, doing jobs for the gangsters and behaving generally anti-social are the way to success.

The action moves through six levels spread over three different cities, each based on a real US city: Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco) and Vice City (based on Miami). To finish a level, a certain score must be reached. Stealing cars and crashing into traffic, driving over pedestrians and killing cops all raise the score, but the big points are made through jobs. Answering phones or entering special cars brings mission assignments, from simple ""ditch-a-hot-car"" jobs to supporting bank robberies or carrying out assassinations. Completing a mission will raise the score substantially and also increase the score multiplier, so that completing the next felony will gain even more points.

Criminal behavior comes with a price of course: if policemen witness a crime, the player's wanted level rises. At the lowest level, a single police car might give chase, whereas at the highest level whole car squads hunt the player, the police set up roadblocks and shoot to kill. The only way to evade the cops is to find a respray shop and get a new paint job with new license plates. This costs money which is deducted from the score, however. But even dying or being arrested are not the end. The player has several lives, and ending up in jail simply results in being stripped of all weapons and armor and the score multiplier being lowered.

The entire action is viewed from a top-down perspective, which zooms out while driving a car, for a better overview at high speeds. The cities are many screens large and can be freely explored. Crates are scattered over the cities, which might include weapons (from pistols to rocket launchers), armor or other bonus items: extra lives, police bribes (used to reduce the wanted level to zero) and get-out-of-jail-free cards (used to retain score multiplier and weapons when busted). Dozens of different vehicles are available for the taking, each with unique characteristics: a bus will handle very differently than a sports car."

The game takes place at an undisclosed time in the near future. Unlike the first game which featured three different cities, Grand Theft Auto 2 only features a single town, but it's divided in three districts which are unlocked one at a time: downtown, residential and industrial. Like in the original the player goes around answering phones to initiate various missions. The game uses an overhead camera in a 3D landscape and allows the player to freely explore the city and steal any vehicle the player sets his or her eyes on. To unlock new districts the player must reach a certain score which is done by committing crimes and finishing missions.

Because the game now features multiple criminal gangs, the player must choose allegiances. Performing missions for one gang, will decrease the player's reputation for another. When the player commits crimes he also becomes wanted by the local police, but as more crimes are committed without shaking the police, they will give way for first SWAT Teams, then Special Agents and finally the army.

New features include the ability to save at the church, when donating enough money, and various side missions, such as becoming a taxi driver to ear money. There are also many new cars with weapons attached such as a firetruck with a flamethrower and a car with machine guns."

Over time, however, KEMO's crime rate had risen so far that the economy collapsed and the city descended into disorder. Criminals roamed the streets in armored hovercars, terrorizing the citizens of KEMO without fear of retribution. In 2029, OmniCorp promised city officials that it could clean up KEMO and return it to normal. The offer was accepted, and the corporation began the construction of a massive wall around the city under the guise of a ""defensive measure"". The wall was completed three years later, and the only exit sealed shut, turning KEMO into a massive prison city for all inside, criminal or otherwise. The outraged population reacted violently, and the city degenerated.

Ten years later, in 2043, OmniCorp decided to test the behavior altering chemical Hydergine 344 on KEMO. This chemical was supposed to pacify the citizens of KEMO, and was distributed through the city's water supply. Unfortunately, OmniCorp failed to predict the chemical's reaction to the stagnant water, resulting in massive brain damage and insanity in the many of KEMO's citizens. More than half the population became crazed killers overnight.

Drake Edgewater, a 21st-century cab driver and one of the lucky few unaffected by the spreading virus, is desperate to escape the city alive. Driving his '52 Checker ""hovercab"" armed with an assortment of headlight-mounted weaponry, he delivers passengers and packages for what money he can make to upgrade his vehicle and escape."

Seeds must also be watered until the fruit or vegetable matures. Once the crops are ready for harvest, they can be placed in a shipping bin where they'll be collected and paid for. In addition to farming, players will interact with local villagers and partake in seasonal events such as the Tomato Festival and Fireworks Display.

"Heart of Darkness","","PAL","","Infogrames","Amazing Studios","1998-07-31","1","No","Platform | Horror","Not Rated","Heart of Darkness is a cinematic platform video game developed by French developer Amazing Studio for the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows. A Game Boy Advance port was announced in 2001 but it was never released.

The game places players in the role of a child named Andy as he attempts to rescue his dog who has been kidnapped by shadow-like spectres. The game has about half an hour of storytelling cinematic sequences, thousands of 2D animated frames, and uses pre-rendered background scenery. The game was supervised by game developer Éric Chahi, known for Another World, this time with a team of artists and developers. The game also features an original score by film and television composer Bruce Broughton.

The game is completely unrelated to the Joseph Conrad novel of the same name.

Gameplay
Heart of Darkness is a cinematic platformer in the vein of Éric Chahi's previous game Another World. The player controls Andy, who faces various dangers in search of his dog, Whisky. The player progresses through the game's linear storyline by navigating various environments and solving puzzles, all whilst attempting to keep Andy from being killed by evil shadows, hungry wildlife, and perilous obstacles. Along with basic movement, such as running, jumping, and climbing, certain sections of the game give Andy additional abilities. The plasma cannon allows Andy to shoot lightning at shadows in order to disintegrate them. The special powers, which can also be used offensively against enemies, can additionally be used to grow and destroy trees born from seeds. The player has unlimited tries, with Andy returning to the most recent checkpoint when he is killed.

Plot
The game begins with the protagonist; a young boy known as Andy being abused by his teacher for sleeping in class where it is revealed that he has nyctophobia (fear of the dark). Being instructed that same day by his teacher to watch the solar eclipse, Andy takes his beloved dog Whisky to the park where dark forces steal Whisky away, prompting Andy to use his assortment of inventions and machines to get him back. Andy travels to another world called the Darkland in a homemade spaceship which promptly crashes and he has to face an assortment of obstacles to rescue Whisky and find his way home.

Throughout the game, Andy is tasked with fighting living shadow creatures and dark monsters while traversing several hostile alien environments such as a canyon, swamp, underwater cave, and lava river. He receives help in this quest from a peaceful alien race called Amigos whom he befriends, and from magic powers he obtains from a meteor referred to as the ""magic rock"" that can kill all the shadows of fear. The main antagonist is an evil sorcerer known as the Master of Darkness who intended to capture Andy instead of his dog. Somewhat resembling Andy's teacher from the beginning of the game, the Master of Darkness has an interest in capturing Andy and sends his minions to pursue him. Another major antagonist is the Vicious Servant; a sniveling pink creature that serves the Master but is quick to betray him for personal benefit.

After traveling across the varying alien environments and fighting alongside the Amigos, Andy finds himself inside the Master of Darkness' lair where he proceeds to free Whisky and join forces with the Vicious Servant to help overthrow the Master of Darkness. Planning to use the magic rock's power to destroy the black hole at the lair's center. However, Andy is double-crossed by the Servant who kicks Whisky into the black hole and sends Andy into an ambush. Andy ends up fending off droves of shadow creatures and successfully following through with his plan, but falls into the black hole himself along with the Master of Darkness as the structure around him collapses.

The black hole's center is the heart of darkness and there Andy must fight the Master and face his fears once and for all. Upon succeeding the darkness dissipates and Andy awakens in his treehouse, believing the experience was all just a dream but after Andy and Whisky go to sleep and it is shown Andy has likely gotten over his fear of the dark, the player is shown the Amigos cleaning up the wreckage of Andy's ship and proving the adventure was perhaps real."

The story dates back to January 6, 1482, the day of the 'Festival of Fools' in Paris. Quasimodo, the deformed bell ringer, is introduced by his crowning as Pope of Fools.

Esmeralda, a beautiful Gypsy with a kind and generous heart, captures the hearts of many men but especially those of Quasimodo and his adopted father, Claude Frollo. Frollo is torn between his lust and the rules of the church. He orders Quasimodo to get her. Quasimodo is caught and whipped and ordered to be tied down in the heat. Esmeralda, seeing his thirst, offers him water. It saves her, for she captures the heart of the hunchback.

She is later accused of the attempted murder of Phoebus, whom Frollo attempted to kill in jealousy, and is sentenced to death by hanging. Quasimodo saves her by bringing her to the cathedral under the law of sanctuary. Clopin rallies the Truands (criminals of Paris) to charge the cathedral and rescue Esmeralda. The king, seeing the chaos, vetoes the law of sanctuary and commands his troops to take Esmeralda out and kill her. When Quasimodo sees the Truands, he assumes they are there to hurt Esmeralda, so he drives them off. Frollo betrays Esmeralda by handing her to the troops and watches while she is hanged. Quasimodo pushes him from Notre-Dame to his death. Quasimodo then goes to Mount Faucon (a huge graveyard in Paris where all hanged bodies are thrown), lies next to her corpse and eventually dies of starvation. One year later, excavationists find the skeletons of Esmeralda with a broken neck and Quasimodo locked in an embrace."

In 1998, the game was released with Image Fight as a one-disc doublebill on PlayStation and Sega Saturn.
The game centers around an unusual alien invasion against a colony planet in the year 2249—the aliens themselves are microscopic creatures that invade, infect, and kill the colonists. Scientists have deployed the microscopic fighter X-002 into the body of the hapless woman whose body has been invaded by the alien queen.

Image Fight (イメージファイト) is a 1988 vertically scrolling shoot 'em up arcade game developed and published by Irem. The arcade game was also ported for the Nintendo Entertainment System, PC Engine (Japan-only), Sharp X68000 (Japan-only), and FM Towns (Japan-only) in 1990.

The player flies a futuristic red ship. R-Type Final identifies this ship as the OF-1 Daedalus, but it is not known if that was the ship's original name. However, the term OF-1 does appear in the NES version's instruction manual, as well as in the official artwork for the sequel, Image Fight II. The game appears to be set inside a holographic simulator, like the holodeck on Star Trek: The Next Generation. In the NES version of the game, the first 5 missions are called ""Combat Simulation Stages"" and the last 3 missions are called ""Real Combat Stages"".

Two separate titles on one very collectable compilation for the shooter fan. X Multiply is similar to Gradius with claustrophobic confines and organic add ons to the ship giving it floaty, stamen like guards. Image Fight is more a chunky R Type tribute with nice multi directional shots and an old school feel. The rarest of the Arcade Gears series."

Based on a cult TV show in Japan where contestants have to guide a rod in between two barriers of pulsating volts of electricity to the end of the maze without touching either side as this will lead to a shock of electricity, you would hardly even conceive this idea to be a practical videogame.

The game entails moving around what appears to be a dot on the screen since this actually represents the stick in a 3D world that is viewed from ""top down"" on the head of the rod. By directing this rod through the maze without hitting either of the barriers, you will take victory. However speed also must be taken into consideration since a time limit is established for each course. Players can also change speeds by simply pressing the X button to drop down a speed or circle to speed up with a total of five speeds available. The unlimited number of mazes are set through various background courses and obstacles from spinning blades, poker machines and even a metal robot."

The game begins when Rocky & Hopper are watchin the TV and they see the advertisement of the evil pirate bird that invites them to his mini games tournament and the prize for the winner is a treasure. 

The game features various games modes: 
-Story mode: In this mode Rocky and Hopper are invited to be a challengers in a competition 
- VS Mode 
- Team mode 
- Free Mode 

The game features 11 different mini games. And music like ""Get down on it"" by Cool & the Gang or ""Staying alive"" by the Bee Gees in electronic versions."
"Iwatobi Penguin Rocky x Hopper 2 - Tantei Monogatari","","Region Not Set","","Culture Publishers","Culture Publishers","1998-02-26","4","No","Action","E10+ - Everyone 10+","Rocky X Hopper 2 is just like it's prequel, a party game. Consisting of 12 mini games. The stars of the game are two penguins, Rocky and Hopper who run a detective agency. One day they get hired by Pinky the penguin to search for her lost cat. Seeing a possibility to earn a quick buck, Brownie joins in the search. During their adventure, the cat is kidnapped by an evil scientist, which happens to be a poodle. 

These story segments are all presented in FMV and add lots of humor to the game. Adding to the craziness of it all are FMV commercials that can be unlocked by completing the story mode. In these you can see Rocky and Hopper star in Japanese spots for a product called ""Super Hard"" hair mousse. 

But what the game really is about. is the minigames. These are fun when played alone, but when played with 2-4 people the craziness of this game really starts to shine through. 4 players can play using a multitap, but also by sharing just 2 controllers and selecting the strangely called ""Love Mode"". 

Minigames range from memory games, where one must flip 2 cards at a time and try to match animal sounds to score points, up to a little shooting gallery where you have to avoid shooting the kitty and must try to shoot the evil poodle before someone else does. 

Another game has you dialing a phone number as quick as possible. All numbers on the phone are presented by buttons on the Playstation pad. Now the tricky part is that these symbols are written on individual cards which spin, twist and turn at different rates, so that you can never see the whole 8 symbol combination at once. Making this a game of quick reflexes. 

The popcorn game: You are stuck in a square room with a popcorn machine in the middle. The object is to collect as much popcorn as possible. The machine spits out popcorn in all directions, and once the popcorn touches the floor, it's gone. When catching popcorn in mid-air by jumping towards it you get more points then by just waiting for it to drop into your beak. Sometimes there is also different colored popcorn that is shot out, which accounts for more points. And one last thing, at certain times the popcorn machine starts spinning around. When you then touch it, you also start to spin for several seconds. That wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for the fact that when you're spinning, you can't jump. Hereby adding a new tactic of trying to push you opponents against the spinning popcorn machine, while you will be able to jump over their heads gobbling up as much popcorn as possible. 

Another game has you popping balloons of different colors, which are floating at various heights. These all have different point values. The longer you hold down the jump button, the higher you will be able to jump. But then again, jump too high and you will get stuck in the ceiling for a few seconds. When jumping on top of another penguins head, you also get bounced of higher, adding to the danger of getting stuck in the ceiling. 

At the start of each game you are being shown which buttons on the controller must be used. 

The only minigame which could be confusing without a little explanation is a memory game where the 4 penguins all stand next to each other, facing the camera. You can start by pressing any button you like. The 2nd played must repeat your command and add one of his own. The 3rd one must repeat both of these and also add one himself. This is repeated until someone can't remember all the commands or simply make a mistake. 

All in all, this is a very fun little game, which becomes extremely enjoyable and hilarious when playing with multiple people."

"JAPAN ZEN NIPPON PRO WRESTLING ouja no tamashi","","NTSC-J","Japan","Human Entertainment, Inc.","Human Club","1999-04-08","2","Yes","Fighting | Sports","T - Teen","Wrestling is a martial art that uses grappling type techniques such as clinch fighting, throws and takedowns, joint locks, pins and other grappling holds. A wrestling bout is a physical competition, between two (occasionally more) competitors or sparring partners, who attempt to gain and maintain a superior position. There are a wide range of styles with varying rules with both traditional historic and modern styles. Wrestling techniques have been incorporated into other martial arts as well as military hand-to-hand combat systems.

Zen-Nippon Pro Wrestling is a series of wrestling video games based on the professional wrestling promotion All Japan Pro Wrestling. The games were developed by Natsume and released for the Super Famicom and Game Boy. The second game in the series was localized for Western markets and released under the name Natsume Championship Wrestling. Subsequent 3D games based on All Japan have been released, including two using the Zen-Nippon name, but none of them were developed by Natsume.

Zen-Nippon Pro Wrestling: Ouja no Kon is a 3D Japanese wrestling game released in 1999 for the PlayStation. It was published by Human Entertainment (and later Spike) and developed by Human Club.

One of the main game features is the Powerball system. This system provides each wrestler with two to four Powerballs that can be used in a match in several different ways. Powerballs allow each wrestler to use a special move that is specifically assigned to them, they can be used to give regular moves extra power, or they can be used to kick out of a pin attempt when your wrestler would not normally have the strength to do so.

The game features 25 wrestlers (including one hidden wrestler) from the All Japan Pro Wrestling promotion.

There are seven modes of play available in the game: One Night Match, Champion Carnival, Real World Tag League, Battle Royal, Create Edit (Create-a-Wrestler), MVP Season Mode, and Defend Title (hidden mode).

The Success Mode: 
The Success Mode is the game's most compelling feature[citation needed], combining role-playing game and life simulation games elements with the baseball sport. The basic objective is to train a generic Pawapurokun to become a professional baseball player. The Pawapurokun starts out with low stats, but often ends up being far better than any of the real professional players included in the game. Generally, Pawapurokun begins as an amateur player (ranging from high school, college or company player) who must become a professional in a certain period (usually three years). The Success Mode takes only about 2 hours to complete, but creating a good player requires an extraordinary amount of skill and luck, giving the game almost infinite replay value.[citation needed] Various random events will affect the growth of your player, for example, getting a girlfriend will allow you to regain motivation easily and receive presents (which drastically improve your player's stats) on your birthday. 

Mylife mode: 
Due to the great success of success mode, Konami have someway extended to another game mode called Mylife since Pawapuro 10, which can use created player (or using an NPB player, even creating a player at place) to play in the NPB, with another series of events, through there are no more characters from success mode appears in it.

Jonah Lomu Rugby was the first rugby union game released on the PlayStation platform. At the time of its release, the game received relatively high praise. It was particularly praised for its smoothness of gameplay and the quality of graphics at the time.

Much like another sports title published around the same time, Brian Lara Cricket 99, the commentary is of great note amongst certain gaming circles. Supplied by ex-television broadcasters Bill Beaumont and Bill McLaren, the commentary includes oft-hilarious and memorable lines, such as ""Oh! Mercy me! What a tackle! That could've put him in Ward 4!"", followed by ""I hope not Bill, that's a maternity ward!"". One particularly quirky piece of commentary is the line ""digging in like a demented mole there"", which refers to players hurling themselves into rucks. The two commentators were seen to have a great level of banter with one another, adding to the flow and realism of the game."

"Khamrai","","NTSC-J","Japan","Namco","Alpha Unit","2000-10-05","1","No","Role-Playing","Not Rated","As suggested by the title, a creative spelling of Kamurai, or ""The Coming of God"", the world of Khamrai is a mystical place. A place where humans and gods live amongst each other, although the relationship between these two is anything but amicable. As such, the world of Khamrai is segregated into the six floating kingdoms of Fire, Giant Earth, Light, Growth, Doom, and Big Sky.

In RPG tradition, the name of each floating nation is representative of the idealogy of its people. For example, those of Giant Earth are agriculturalists preferring to live as one with nature, and will do whatever is necessary both to preserve the land and their way of life. Similarly, the people of Light are philsophists and scholars, placing the greatest importance upon the pursuit of knowledge and greater understanding.

The characters design are the handiwork of Haruhio Mikamoto of Macross fame.
CHARACTERS:
Kagato: Hailing from the kingdom of Dark, Kagato was orphaned, leaving him to be raised by an elderly priest named Obaba. Kagato serves as the title's obligatory capricious teenaged adventurer.
Fushi: A member of a noble family of gods from the kingdom of Light, he tends to take his station in life for granted.
Syuon: Suffering from a case of wanderlust as well as rather questionable set of ethics, her adventures eventually see her meeting up and joining with Kagato.
Sayohime: Another familiar RPG character type, Sayohime is the selfess healer who lives only to aid others.
Kiriha: Kihira was also raised and instructed by Obaba, making her foster-sister to Kagato.
Yu: Yu carves out a living for himself by hunting down magical beasts.
Kazura: This young princess is handy with magic and leads a group of immortals despite her age.
Tukikage: The female advisor is knowledgeable in the ways of life thanks to her immortality and stolid nature.
Obaba: Despite his old age, Obaba is fully capable of taking care of himself. He has mentoredboth Kagato and Kiriha in his ways.
Kujyaku: While he may not be much of a looker, this hunter-for-hire always keeps the safety of the public his top priority, mainly by destroying dangerous monsters.


Once the battle has ensued, the party members act on their own accord within these guideline. The only direct control possible to make at this point is target selection."

At the onset of the game, only four of these fighters are available, but by beating opponents in the game's somewhat cheesy Story mode, gamers will eventually have 14 fighters to choose from. After completing the daunting task that is Story mode, players will have an even better time competing in the game's primary Ranking mode. Here they must fight anywhere between three and 12 fighters to win the title belt and gain valuable experience points. After winning a title, they can then defend their title to gain more points or open up new championship tournaments.

It was also released on the Sega Saturn.

This compilation includes the classic games: 

- Konami's Boxing (1984):
A boxing game with a couple of moves, with the standard jabs complimented by body punches and the ability to dodge, duck or raise your guard. Each punch weakens your opponent's strength, although going long enough without being hit can see this begin to recover.

There are nine skill levels to beat, with increasing abilities as the game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring). The points system rewards long rallies and large winning margins, as you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for each point of the winning margin.

Meanwhile, other talented fighters will set out, some for reasons related to Dragless (like Terrific Forelock, the bodyguard and childhood friend of Princess Mirona, who's out to save her after she has been kidnapped by the Demon King), others not at all (like Misa Atago, who goes on a trip to ease the pain of her break-up with her boyfriend). In the end, all of them will learn about Dragless and realize how serious the situation is."

In designing and making this game, we have tried to maintain a certain
philosophy of gameplay based on the following points:

An easy to use interface that lets the player concentrate on the game, not
the controls, but which also allows for a deep and rich gameplay experience.

Maximum interaction with the game enviroment. This includes interaction with
the background, as well as the different characters. The player is not stuck
on a single path through the game, and the choices you make truly affect the
enviroment and the outcome of the game.

In tone, we have striven to produce a realistic, yet slightly cartoonish
enviroment. We hope this enhances the player's enjoyment of the game, and
intensifies the story's interesting mix of humour and drama.

Little Big Adventure is a strange and mysterious journey through a surreal
and dangerous world. You take the role of Twinsen, a young Quetch entreated
in a dream by the Goddess Sendell to come to your planet's rescue. It is your
destiny to restore peace and harmony to your world. You begin your quest
imprisoned in an asylum. From the start it is difficult to know whom to trust
or where to go. The tyrant Dr. Funfrock has taken over your home planet of
Twinsun and has imposed his brutal methods of control over the entire
population. His primary weapons are his ability to clone different species
and teleport these clones anywhere on the planet. There are four main species
on the planet: Quetches (Twinsen is a member of this pony-tailed group),
Grobos (they look like elephants), Spheros (round little guys) and
Rabibunnies.

All species suffer under his reign of terror, but few are capable of
resistance. You must find those who can help you, travelling great distances
in your quest to save the world and stop the evil Dr. Funfrock. At any moment
your enemies may overtake you, stopping you in your pursuit of the quest. Be
wary and you will find a glorious tribute awaits your success."

Unlike its predecessor, Little Princess uses a more traditional RPG battle system, but it still contains many of the same themes of love and music.

Little Princess takes place years after the events of Rhapsody, where the protagonists of the previous game have settled down as the rulers of Marl Kingdom and now have a daughter, Kururu. Kururu gets entangled in a dispute between two families of witches, and must track down the pieces of a shattered gem.

The battles follow a standard RPG battle system of enemies on the opposite side of the screen from the players and commands selected from a text menu. However, two of the characters have companion ""puppets"" that cast magic for them. The puppets level up along with the characters, and when a spell is cast, money is taken instead of magic points."

"LMA Manager 2001","","Region Not Set","","Codemasters","Codemasters","2001-12-01","2","No","Construction and Management Simulation | Sports","","The second LMA game was released - also on PlayStation - in March 2001. Two versions were released, one for the English leagues as before, and another specifically covering the Scottish Premier and Football Leagues. The in-match action is presented by former footballer turned BBC analyst Alan Hansen. Sometimes this version gets caught in between the retro style of the original game, and the 2002 version. Although practically the same as the 2002 version, this contains some differences in the in-match play, and is famed for wingers cutting inside to shoot from ridiculous angles, and goalkeepers who tend to tip shots just inside the far post, making this an often frustrating game. There are also a few mistakes on the game, such as Birmingham City's Bryan Hughes being 29, instead of his proper age at the time, which was 24. It is also occasional for defenders to pick up the ball in their own penalty box, and proceed to kick it out like a keeper, as well as people scoring from their kick-off.
A slight difference from the original is the length of gameplay - this version finishing after 30 seasons in football management while the previous version finished after 50 seasons."
"LMA Manager 2002","","Region Not Set","","Codemasters","Codemasters","2001-10-30","","No","Strategy | Sports","","LMA 2002 was the final version in the series to be released on PlayStation, launched in October 2001. Although chiefly just an update from the 2001 version, the game did prove to be quite a stepping stone from the LMA of old and the LMA seen today.

The first PlayStation 2 incarnation went under the same name when released in April 2002. A significant update from PS1, it allowed players to manage in one of six European leagues, all of which were processed by the game simultaneously (the top two divisions in Italy, Spain, Germany and France were added, in addition to the existing top four divisions in England and Scotland). On the PS2, matches played out in full in a 3D match environment, followed by post-match highlights voiced by famous BBC presenter Gary Lineker alongside the returning Hansen. The game play advanced in this game from the 2001 version, in particular the in-match style. Players tend to shoot early, from around thirty yards, rather than enter into the penalty area."

The terrorist group that attacked the colonies is known as the ""Black Ravens"", led by their fearless leader ""Timoshie Daldahnton""...Codenamed the ""All Kill Wizard"".

The developer of this game is unknown, as the only company shown before the intro screen is Hakuhodo. However, given that Himikogen: Renge was developed by Chime Corporation, it is unlikely that Hakuhodo actually developed Mad Panic Coaster.

In Mad Panic Coaster, you control a boy and a girl (perhaps a brother and sister?) as they sit in a roller coaster car and go through 15 hellish roller coasters. How these roller coasters even got past safety testing is unknown, as they don't have any rails or barriers of any sort. It's up to you to steer the roller coaster car using the d-pad to make sure it stays on the track. The roller coasters also have various monsters, traps, and jumps to avoid. To do this, you use X to jump. Hitting Square will make the girl throw some sort of yellow ball projectile that explodes at a long range, while hitting Circle will make the boy throw that same type of projectile at a shorter range. Falling off the track or getting hit by something will cost you health, and once you run out, you must start the level all over again. Once you make three laps around the track, a rainbow with the words ""lucky"" form around you as they come to a stop, and you move on to the next level. Every three roller coasters, a boss will be fought after completing the third lap. This boss is similar to the regular enemies, except that they take many more hits to kill. To defeat them, you has to either throw enough projectiles at them or survive another three laps."

It features John Madden on the cover. The AI has been boosted and can now hurry in two-minute drill situations, spike the ball, and cover the receivers with better efficiency. Among the innovations in Madden 96, the Create A Player feature was added, which included many position specific mini-games that would determine the ability of the player. The game also was the first in the Madden series to include secret ""classic"" teams, which were unlocked by playing any of the 28 pre-expansion NFL franchises in the playoffs and by winning Super Bowl XXX with that team (a rather easy feat as the playoff tournament system allows a player to abort the game while in the lead and still win). The 28 pre-expansion teams were each represented by a classic era equivalent, which ranged from 1960 (Philadelphia Eagles) to 1986 (New York Giants), although all players identified as number-only. Jacksonville Jaguars and Carolina Panthers, having debuted in 1995, did not have a secret classic team revealed in this manner, nor did the All-Madden team. However, Carolina was attached to the blank slate NFLPA team used for Create-A-Player, and Jacksonville and All-Madden hid the ""superteams"" with players named after the developers; these teams were accessed using unstated cheat codes."

The Madden football series makes its debut on the 32-bit consoles with Madden NFL 97. Like the PC version, the game moves into the world of polygonal 3D graphics, but has a unique set of modes, teams and options.

The game includes the 30 teams of the 1996 NFL season, the 1996 All-Madden team plus 68 classic teams from NFL history. Playing modes include Exhibition, Season and Tournament. All scheduled games during a season can be either played or simulated. The tournament is for either 8 or 16 players in single elimination mode. The game also includes the 30 team's home stadiums plus one extra arena in Hawaii.

Many features introduced in previous titles are reused here: variable weather (including night games), injuries and substitutions, ten different penalties (all adjustable), two skill levels, a bluffing mode for play calling, color commentary by John Madden, instant replays, and team roster editing with player creation (stats are set from a point pool), trading, releasing and signing of free agents. Player records and season progress can be saved to memory card/backup RAM. A new feature is the possibility to change which team is controlled at any time during a game.

During a game, the stadiums are rendered in polygonal texture-mapped 3D, with only the players, referees and ball as bitmaps. The game allows to choose from eight different camera perspectives, including views from the end zones and sidelines, a diagonal view and a ""classic cam"" emulating the perspective of earlier titles in the series on Genesis and SNES."

It is based closely on the previous year's edition, but with the usual updates, revisions and several new features. Compared to versions on other platforms, the 32-bit console version comes with its own graphics engine and selection of teams, modes and options.

The game includes the 30 teams of the 1997 NFL season, the 1997 All-Madden team and 85 classic teams from NFL history, spanning 1960 to 1996. All the team's home stadiums plus the Pro Bowl stadium in Hawaii and the Super Bowl stadium in San Diego are available. Further teams and stadiums can be unlocked via secret codes. Returning playing modes from the predecessor are Exhibition, Season (including Playoffs and Super Bowl, based on the 1997 NFL schedule) and Tournament (8 or 16 player single elimination). Added to these are the new Custom Season and Fantasy Draft. Custom Season allows players to customize the NFL divisions and thus the schedule with all available teams, including the classic teams. Fantasy Draft is a custom tournament mode for four or eight teams. Players create their own teams by giving them names and then drafting players. The tournament consists of a round-robin round followed by semi-finals and finals. The option of creating and trading players also returns, and can be made more realistic by employing salary caps and trading deadlines within a season.

During a game, the same graphics style employed by the previous year's game is used: polygonally-rendered 3D stadiums with players, ball and referees as 2D bitmaps. The camera can be toggled between several perspectives, with most returning from the predecessor, but some being replaced by new ones."

Taking on the role of a magician on a magic carpet, you’ll run through around 50 levels, killing stuff with magic and then collecting its “mana.” Collect enough mana and the next level is opened up. 

The stuff being killed is not defenceless though – far from it. Enemies range from relatively harmless vultures, right through to swarms of undead, firespitting dragons and titanic wyverns. There’s also other mages to contend with – in some levels as many as seven - and that’s where the toughest challenges are at.

Each mage possesses a castle. As long as the castle exists, the mage has a spawning point should he/ she die. The castle is upgradable provided the mage has collected enough mana, so levels quickly fall into a rhythm that is split evenly between fighting the wildlife to collect mana, protecting your own castle, and then attacking your “human” opponents.

So far it probably all sounds pretty standard, but Magic Carpet has a host of ideas that work so well, the game still remains relevant today. The maps are reasonably small (by today’s standards), but they really are open – each map is filled with secrets and dangers to find and avoid. The levels are also morphable – it is possible to destroy environments as it was possible to create volcanoes and gaping chasms.

Because the world is being invaded by aliens, it is up to you and your sidekick Bones to stop the invasion and single handedly save Earth. In order to do so, you must make good use of your special suit, which allows you to do all kinds of things.

The super-suit comes equipped with many features you'll need to utilize in your journey, such as the sniper helmet. This allows you to zoom in on unsuspecting enemies and fire off shots with pinpoint accuracy. There is also a built in parachute (a ribbon-like device) that enables you to glide between different platforms as well as drop down on intruders.

Your suit comes equipped with a chain gun that has an infinite supply of ammunition. You can also pick up special items, like a miniature nuclear bomb and powerful upgrades for your chaingun. In addition to running around and shooting, there are also special means of transportation including a surfboard-like jet and a bomber plane that is used to call in air strikes."

If you win, you advance in rank. If you are very successfully, you can make it all the way up to Khan, leader of the Clan!

Mechwarrior II was developed in-house by Activision as the successor to their original Mechwarrior. While this time there are no dynamic campaign and mercenary actions, the Clan culture is integrated into the two campaigns. Different clans have different mechs and different rules, even different weapons. You can customize your mechs in order to use less than the ""par"" force in order to get a higher rating. The full 3D environment wasn't pretty as this was before the 3D accelerators made their debut, but it's still better than anything that came before.

"Medal of Honor & Underground Double Pack","","Region Not Set","","Electronic Arts","","2002-09-13","1","No","Shooter","Not Rated","Medal Of Honor is the first game to bring gritty WWII action to the PlayStation convincingly. The date is June 5, 1944, just one day before D-Day, and the mission is to go behind enemy lines on a series of search and rescue operations, commando raids, and all-out battles. The twenty-four levels have been designed to authentically recreate real period environments, while the twelve weapon types continue the realistic feel. Using such classics as the Tommy gun and bazooka you must take on twenty different types of enemy, from the Wehrmacht light infantry to the Nazi shock troops, fighting it in some inspired locations--from a U-Boat to a V2 rocket plant. A split-screen option facilitates the two-player mode, really bringing the shoot-'em-up element to the fore. And if all that isn't enough to convince you of Medal Of Honor's pedigree, bear in mind that it comes from the Dreamworks stable, home of a certain Mr Spielberg. 

Medal of Honor Underground is a prequel to Medal of Honor in which you play as Manon, a young French girl recruited by the French Resistance, fighting in the OSS against the coming German onslaught. The Nazis will use suppressive firing squad tactics, tanks, half-tracks, and motorcycles to try to stop you. The game features 22 levels spread throughout 7 missions, with 12 authentic weapons, including the pistol crossbow and the Panzerfaust. A new disguise mode allows Manon access to the Third Reich's most evil secrets. Artificial Intelligence-controlled fellow agents will assist by battling the Gestapo, cracking safes, and driving vehicles. After fighting the Nazis across Europe and North Africa, try battling your friends in Medal of Honor Underground's split-screen multiplayer arenas. ."

The game puts the player in control of Sir Daniel Fortesque: the reanimated skeletal remains of a deceased champion knight whom history holds in high esteem, due to his supposed heroics in battle against the evil sorcerer Zarok who, in 1286, had raised an army of demons and set out to take over the kingdom. The legend has it that Fortesque lead the King's army into battle against Zarok's demonic hordes and that Sir Daniel himself killed the sorcerer during the battle - despite having actually been mortally wounded at the outset - cementing his posthumous status as the ""Hero of Gallowmere""."

Funny haha or weird spooky funny - you decide!

Sony's MediEvil is another step forward for action/adventure games, with a dark, black humorous storyline and an appealing main character, but with the added bonus of being staged on a series of completely free-roaming 3-D levels.

MediEvil centres around the demonic warlord, Zarok, who has harnessed ancient magical powers and sealed the world in eternal night. His sorcery has bewitched the peaceful villagers, turning them into mindless zombies.

Hope comes in the form of Sir Daniel Fortesque, a soldier killed by Zarok in a war hundreds of years ago. Resurrected by the very magic that killed him, Sir Dan realises he must embark on a quest to rid the world of the satanic regime of Zarok, before he can return to his grave once again.

With eleven game areas, and 22 levels in total, Sir Dan must find his way across graveyards and through crypts to get ever closer to his objective. Every level represents the pinnacle of imagination with a dark, Gothic look and a sense of humour that enhances the atmosphere.

Follow the mystical trail of darkness and land in the journey of a lifetime."

Snake must liberate hostages and stop the terrorists from launching a nuclear strike. Cinematic cutscenes were rendered using the in-game engine and graphics, and voice acting is used throughout.

Metal Gear Solid sold more than seven million copies worldwide and shipped 12 million demos. It scored an average of 94/100 on the aggregate website Metacritic. It is regarded as one of the greatest and most important video games of all time and helped popularize the stealth genre and in-engine cinematic cutscenes. It was followed by an expanded version for PlayStation and Windows, Metal Gear Solid: Integral (1999), and a GameCube remake, Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes (2004). It produced numerous sequels, starting with Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (2001), and media adaptations including a radio drama, comics, and novels.

The VR training mode is now stored on a separate third disc, known as the ""VR Disc"", and has been expanded into 300 missions. These new set of missions are divided into four main categories: Sneaking, Weapons, Advanced, and Special. The first three categories feature standard training exercises that test the player's sneaking, shooting, and combat skills, while the fourth category contains less conventional tests involving murder mysteries, giant genome soldiers, and flying saucers. One particular set of missions has the player controlling the Cyborg Ninja, unlocked by either completing a minigame on the PocketStation and uploading the data to the VR Disc or by achieving the Fox rank on the main game. Completing all 300 missions will unlock a concept artwork of Metal Gear RAY, a mech that would later appear in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. Additional content includes preview trailers of Metal Gear Solid from trade events and a photoshoot mode where the player can take photographs of fully expressive polygonal models of Mei Ling and Dr. Naomi after completing the main game. Famitsu magazine rated Metal Gear Solid: Integral a 34 out of 40.

The VR Disc from Integral was released by itself during the same year in other regions as Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions in North America on September 23 and as Metal Gear Solid: Special Missions in the PAL region on October 29. While the content of both, VR Missions and Special Missions, are virtually identical to the VR Disc, the unlocking requirements for the Ninja missions and the photoshoot mode were changed accordingly, so that save data from the main game was no longer required. The Special Missions version also adds an additional requirement in which the user must also own a copy of the original Metal Gear Solid in PAL format in order to start the game - after booting Special Missions on the console, the player will be asked to switch the disc with the first disc from Metal Gear Solid to load data before asking the player to switch back to the Special Missions disc to proceed through the rest of the game. This requirement renders Special Missions incompatible with PlayStation 2 consoles made before the SCPH-70000 model."

The game's voice acting is in English, with text in Japanese.
The game was also packaged with an additional disc of extra missions known as the VR Disc, which was released as a standalone game internationally as ""Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions"" in North America and as ""Metal Gear Solid: Special Missions"" in Europe.

""Money Puzzle Exchanger"" in America), but it replaces the in-game synthesized audio of the original with enhanced digital audio soundtrack from the CD on top of other minor features.

Money Idol Exchanger is a stacking game similar to the Magical Drop, Astro Pop, and Puzzle Bobble series whereby players race to prevent a perpetually falling array of coins in different values from filling up the screen. Coins are combined (vertically and/or horizontally) to form higher valued coins; for example, five '1' coins will form a '5' coin, and two '5' coins will form a '10' coin, and so on, until two '500' coins are put together, at which point both disappear. Coins are arranged and colored to match denominations of the yen coins. Two bonus tiles allow for changes in gameplay. A green RU tile will rank up all coins of the same denomination; for example, all '10' coins will become '50' coins. A blue ER title will erase all coins of the same value. The game is won when any coin reaches the bottom of the opponent's screen.

In the single player mode, one of two characters can be selected who attempt to beat up to seven idiosyncratically named characters with names like Debtmiser, Mightdealer, Eldylabor, and Cherrybeiter. In the two player mode, both players fight each other until victory. The quicker and more efficiently each player clears out their screen, the quicker the other player's screen will fill up. Since filled screens offer the most opportunity for chaining together large combos, the tide can turn very quickly.

There is also another single player mode called Solo Mode. Any character can be played in this mode. The aim in Solo Mode is to continually clear the screen from coins and try to keep the game going for as long as possible."

All levels have a time limit, and the game scores players depending on the tiles they've jumped on and the time they take to reach the goal.

To avoid any disorientation, arrows guide you to the next marker. Each area, be it snowy or volcanic, has characteristic features and hazards, yet this doesn't stop a repetitive feel developing.

Scream Team (released as Monsters, Inc. Scare Island in Europe and on PC in the United States) is a 2001 platform game developed by Artificial Mind and Movement and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 and Disney Interactive for Microsoft Windows. The game is based on the 2001 film Monsters, Inc.. In 2011, the game was made available on the PlayStation Store.

The game begins with an orientation program hosted by Roz, who shows the monsters the basics of their training. The levels are divided among three training grounds located on Scare Island. With names hinting at the nature of their design, the Urban Training Grounds, Desert Training Grounds and Arctic Training Grounds contain four areas to be explored. Each region ranges in scenery from a city park to a frozen lake, and players can choose to play as either Sulley or Mike, with each monster having different moves and scare abilities. Each level's loading screen features a picture of either Mike or Sulley to show who is recommended for the level.

The objective of the game is to successfully scare all the robot children (known as ""Nerves"") on the island and graduate from monster training with top honors. This is accomplished by collecting bronze, silver and gold medals that are awarded throughout the game. The bronze medal is required to complete a level and can be obtained by scaring five Nerves; this also unlocks a short clip from the movie. A silver medal can be obtained by finding and collecting 10 ""Monsters, Inc."" Tokens scattered through a level. A gold medal can be obtained by scaring all eight Nerves in a level. Obtaining the four bronze medals in each training ground unlocks a hidden item that may help the player reach previously unreachable areas. There are also races with Randall Boggs, which when won, also unlocks a short clip from the movie.

Items used include Extra Try Tokens (which give extra lives to the player), Monsters, Inc. Tokens (which earn silver medals for every ten collected) and Primordial Ooze (the substance that gives the monsters their scare power). The random Bag O' Calories increases health, while mailboxes provide tips and information to assist the player. Nerves and items may be hidden, but can be discovered by searching in and around boxes and other objects."

Similar to mother games in the genre, there's a brief tutorial of sorts, and then you're off to gather your own creatures, earning better seeds and other breeding components as you go. Just be careful with your critters, because if they die in battle, they're gone for good.

The vehicles are alive, and have personalities as much as they have driving characteristics. The courses are also cartoonish in nature.

In this game, when you choose a car with power and speed, he looks mean. A car with loose handling will look crazy, and have a funny bouncing animation while driving. In fact, you don't need to look at their statistics to know how they will drive, you can tell by their expresions.

The courses are exagerated at least, and surreal at times. One is a trip through a haunted house, another has you driving through a giant world with boundries defined by playing cards and candy. Even the more standard tracks have zany scenery and extreme corners or hills.

Along the tracks you pick up objects that allow you to fire missles, speed up, become invunerable, etc. adding a battle aspect to the race. All damage is cartoonish, however, and there is no blood or real violence."

Above ground, peace returned again. 

Half a year passed, suddenly the Blocks began to overflow in three nations.One after another America, India and Egypt became flooded in blocks. 

Susumu Hori and his Rival Driller, Anna Hottenmeyer; urgently began to dig to the depths of the earth. Meanwhile, Susumu's father, Taizou Hori; Susumu'selder brother, Ataru Hori; Anna's Robot Assistant, Horinger Z and Susumu's roomate, Puchi, were all digging to the depths of the earth, aiming for the resolution of this disaster. 

What is the probable cause of this latest incident? 
And, among the 6 Drillers, who will be the one to resolve this disaster? 

Our hero can drill up, down, left and right. Drilling through single blocks would take forever, so it's fortunate that blocks of the same color form into groups that vanish when only one of the blocks is drilled. This allows for chain reactions, since vanishing blocks will often cause other blocks to fall and form new groups. Alas, these falling blocks are also deadly if they hit Mr. Driller. 

If all Mr. Driller had to do was drill, life would be easy. But he also has to keep refilling his oxygen supply by collecting air capsules scattered throughout the blocks. The deeper he goes, the faster his air runs out. Hampering his progress even further are brown ""X-blocks"" that take five drill strikes to disappear and remove 20% of Mr. Driller's air when broken.

- Motos (1985): An arcade game that was released by Namco in 1985. It runs on Namco Super Pac-Man hardware but with a video system like that used in Mappy. It has 62 levels. 
The player must maneuver a bumper car to bump enemies off the edge of the playfield while they attempt to do the same to it. Power-ups give the car extra bumping power and the ability to jump over gaps in the playfield. 

- Sky Kid (1985): A horizontal scrolling shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1985. It runs on Namco Pac-Land hardware but with a video system like that used in Dragon Buster.

A sequel named Sky Kid Deluxe was released in 1986. It introduced several new enemies and missions. 
The players play as the Sky Kids ""Red Baron"" and ""Blue Max"", which are references to Manfred von Richthofen, the famous World War I flying ace, and the prestigious order Pour le Mérite, informally known as Blue Max. The Sky Kids fly around in biplanes and are assigned specific targets during the missions. These missions involve bombing specific targets. 

- King & Balloon (1980): A fixed shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1980. It runs on Namco Galaxian hardware but with an extra Z80 processor to drive a DAC for speech; the King speaks when he is captured (""HELP!""), when he is rescued (""Thank you""), and when he is carried away (""BYE BYE!""). Additionally, the balloons make the same ""droning"" sound as the ships in Galaxian, which was released the previous year. The player's shots also have the same sound effect as the player ship in said game. 
The player controls two green men (likely soldiers in the king's army) with an orange cannon that fires at squads of descending balloons. You must protect the king and prevent him from being captured and carried away by one of the balloons. 

- Rolling Thunder (1986): A run and gun arcade game that was released by Namco in 1986. It runs on the Namco System 86 hardware platform and was licensed for US distribution to Atari Games.

The player takes control of Albatross, a member of Interpol's ""Rolling Thunder"" espionage unit. Albatross's mission is to save a missing female agent named Leila Blitz from a secret society named Geldra located in New York. 
Albatross must travel through two different segments or ""stories"", each comprised of five stages, for a total of ten stages."

Returning to the flavour of the original Need for Speed, this adds a new Pursuit mode, where you must out run the cops through fast, open area tracks, while also out-lasting the rest of the pack. Another new mode is knockout, where you race through all the tracks, and whoever is last after each race is knocked out. The winner is, of course, the one that lasts the distance. Almost every course in the game has one or more shortcuts. 

The cars include Ferrari 550 Maranello, Ferrari 355 F1 Spider, Italdesign Scighera, Lamborghini Diablo SV, Lamborghini Countach, Jaguar XJR-15, Jaguar XK8, Aston Martin DB7, '98 Corvette C5, Mercedes SL600 and the Mercedes CLK GTR."

"NFL Quarterback Club 97","","Region Not Set","","Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.","Iguana Entertainment","1996-08-27","2","No","Sports","E - Everyone","It must be frustrating for a game company to produce a sports title and know it's inferior to those produced by EA Sports. Case in point: Acclaim's new NFL Quarterback Club 97 for the Playstation. Compared to EA's brilliant Madden NFL '97, NFL Quarterback Club 97 is simply second-rate. Though NFL Quarterback Club 97 does have some merits, there's not enough here to make it worth its hefty price.

NFL QB Club utilizes many of the same gameplay elements seen in Madden '97 - including the kicking T-meter, the three-quarter overhead primary camera angle, and the button assignments and controls. Player animations are fluid and realistic (the tackles are some of the best going), and the large - though a tad cartoony - player sprites have clearly visible jersey numbers and names. However, the players never seem to move quickly enough: For example, the great Emmitt Smith lumbers downfield as though he's running in sand. Inclement weather options, like snow and rain, look ridiculous. Moreover, penalties are highly unrealistic, with defensive and offensive pass interference called at least once during every set of downs (while almost nothing else is called throughout the entire game). And how could there be no coin toss to determine who kicks and who receives? Sheesh.

To be fair, NFL QB Club 97 boasts a singularly impressive feature: a historic simulation mode. Players can choose among 50 different classic NFL game situations and try to rewrite history. Imagine...it's December 23, 1973. The Dallas Cowboys are down 28-13 to the 49ers. With under a minute remaining, the Boys score a TD and recover an onside kick. Can you complete one of the greatest comebacks in NFL history? It's this type of do-or-die drama that the game's historic sim mode provides. And if that's not enough, there's a custom simulation mode, which allows gamers to create and save up to five game situations, right down to the exact game circumstances (weather, time remaining, score, etc.).

While this game has some admirable qualities, in the end it falls short of the high standards set by Madden '97. Unless you harbor a deep hatred for John Madden and his know-it-all wisecracks, leave NFL Quarterback Club 97 on the shelves."

"NHL 2000","","NTSC","United States of America","EA Sports","EA Sports","1999-09-30","8","Yes","Sports","E - Everyone","The millennium installment in the NHL series brought as usual updated rosters, featuring for the first time the Atlanta Thrashers, plus enhanced graphics and sound.

The two main features of the game are the new Dynasty mode, allowing a player to lead a team to success for 10 straight seasons, while keeping an eye on the new talent on the yearly drafts and trading with other teams, and the face import feature, which gives the chance to assign each custom player their own face based on a photo. To do so, a photo must be placed in a folder, imported and then hotspots (head shape, eyes, nose and mouth) must be set, to define how the texture will be mapped into the face model. 

Gameplay became a lot faster and tougher, and two new moves were included: ""Big Hit"", to flatten the oppositions' golden boy, and ""Special Movement"", to go around those tough defenders with ease. Other new features include individual player and goalie boost (to give an handicap for a team), jersey selection, including classic throwback jerseys.

One of the most important changes done to the game was how the game timer worked: before, the period length on the clock matched the time set by the player, but starting with NHL 2000, every period has 20 minutes which are compressed into the time set by the player. This makes penalties a lot shorter (a minor elapses in just 30 seconds in a five minute period setting) thus reducing the powerplay percentage, which experienced players could keep in the high 90's in previous games, but also fixes the handicap of goaltenders in played games (a goaltender that suffered a single goal would have his GAA a lot higher than a goalie that suffered more goals in a simulated game).

The rest of the game remains as usual: 28 teams can play in a season (with the ability to choose between a short, medium or long season length), setting the then new NHL overtime loss point, playoffs (with best of 1, 3, 5 or 7 matches), international tournament and shootout. The beginner mode continues to be featured, and allowing players to feel the ice for the first time without having to deal with complicated controls, penalties or tough opponents. 

Bill Clement replaced Daryl ""Razor"" Reaugh in colour commentary, and Jim Hughson remains in play by play. Alternative rock band Garbage provided the lead track (Push it!, from their Version 2.0 album)."

Outside of the season and playoff modes, NHL 2001 allows gamers to use a total of 18 international teams and four all-star teams.

Several new features have been added to the mix including ""Big Hit"" and ""Big Shot"" buttons for enhanced gameplay. Also new to gameplay is ""The Momentum Meter,"" where a team's performance is affected by the game's momentum.

Along the usual and almost obligatory NHL roster updates, the International mode first featured in the previous version was expanded, allowing players to choose IIHF rules and rink size.

Graphically, the arena is more detailed with more rinkside features, and ice reflections, player faces were improved and stand more seamlessly into the model, enhanced motion capture result in better animated hits (with the ability to break the glass with a well-placed body check making a return), shots and saves, and finally an higher polygon count complete the graphic enhancements to the game.

As graphic changes aren't enough to make a game better, gameplay was also tweaked, with computer players being smarter, both in offense and defense. Shooting was tweaked (slap shots are easier to pull, players no longer skate in circles to do some backhand shots and must be facing the goal to shoot, particularly in one timers) and a new special move brings dekes, spin-o-ramas and the kind of moves Jágr, Fedorov and Selänne pull when one-on-one with the goalie. However, if the player gets too close to the crease, the referee might want to review the play in the new video goal judge, so the player must think twice before trying to pull a ""Brett Hull"". For newcomers to the sport, a new Beginner mode allows players to get used to the ice without having to concern with penalties or an overly strong opponent.

The season mode was also improved, with the players now having streaks that affect either positively or negatively his abilities. Debuting the Nashville Predators, players can either choose to play with their initial roster, or do a fantasy expansion draft.

Like in the previous year, Jim Hughson and Darryl Reaugh liven up matches with play by play and colour commentary."

For example, some players may be smaller but are fast, while others may be slow but possess the strength and size to do all the dirty work. For instance, if a large, fast player such as Eric Lindros gets moving at high speed, the power behind his check is greater than what someone like Pierre Turgeon could produce. The game sports most of the usual play modes, and you can always take on a friend in the Versus mode. If you edit a player, the name and number will appear on the player's back, which is a great feature that lets you put yourself in the game.

The school's Sensei, Mugensai, turned himself into a hamster to evade his pursuers. The trio was then taken to a secret base to become the legendary Hurricanegers to fight the Jakanja."
"Nippon Sumo Kyoukai Kounin: Nihon Ohzumo","日本相撲協會公認 日本大相撲","NTSC-J","Japan","Konami","Konami","2000-07-13","1","No","Sports","E - Everyone","Nihon Sumo Kyoukai Kounin: Nihon Ohzumo is a sumo wrestling released for the PlayStation on July 13, 2000 in Japan only, developed and published by Konami, as the first game in the series. 

Sumo is a competitive full-contact sport where a wrestler (rikishi) attempts to force another wrestler out of a circular ring (dohyo) or to touch the ground with anything other than the soles of the feet. The sport originated in Japan, the only country where it is practiced professionally. It is generally considered to be a gendai budo (a modern Japanese martial art), though this definition is incorrect as the sport has a history spanning many centuries.

Many ancient traditions have been preserved in sumo, and even today the sport includes many ritual elements, such as the use of salt purification, from the days when sumo was used in the Shinto religion. Life as a rikishi is highly regimented, with rules laid down by the Sumo Association. Most sumo wrestlers are required to live in communal ""sumo training stables"" known in Japanese as heya where all aspects of their daily lives - from meals to their manner of dress - are dictated by strict tradition.

The winner of a sumo bout is either:
- The first wrestler to force his opponent to step out of the ring.
- The first wrestler to force his opponent to touch the ground with any part of his body other than the bottom of his feet.

On rare occasions the referee or judges may award the win to the wrestler who touched the ground first; this happens if both wrestlers touch the ground at nearly the same time and it is decided that the wrestler who touched the ground second had no chance of winning as, due to the superior sumo of his opponent, he was already in an irrecoverable position. The losing wrestler is referred to as being shini-tai (dead body) in this case.

Sumo matches take place in a dohyo: a ring, 4.55 metres in diameter and 16.26 square meters in area, of rice-straw bales on top of a platform made of clay mixed with sand. A new dohyo is built for each tournament by the yobidashi. At the center are two white lines, the shikiri-sen, behind which the wrestlers position themselves at the start of the bout. A roof resembling that of a Shinto shrine may be suspended over the dohyo.

Nippon Sumo Kyoukai Kounin - Nihon Ohzumo is a sumo wrestling game by Konami Sports. It's a simulation game where you are the master at a sumo school, and you have to train your students to become great sumo wrestlers.

In the game the player doesn't control the sumo wrestler during the fights, instead, he control the stats behind the fights by training his wrestlers. The player can also recruit new trainees by taking them to restaurants and interviewing them. When training his wrestlers, the player can choose to bring up either their strength or their stamina.

Manufacturer's description:

Real wrestlers training simulation 171 wrestlers appeared in the real name. Introduced the motion capture technology, and in exactly the full force of sumo, expand the play is gripping in a commentary full of a sense of reality. In addition, it can be possible to create a wrestler original, dream match-up of real-name wrestlers and wrestlers raised also enjoy.

Although the game is a sequel to the video game Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee, it is considered a spin-off title in the Oddworld series, and not part of the main Oddworld Quintology. It was released in November 1998 for the PlayStation video game console and in December 1998 for Microsoft Windows. It was re-released on the PlayStation Network in October 2009.

The game continues the story of Abe, charting his efforts to save his fellow Mudokons from another plot by the Glukkons to exploit them. Abe discovers that the Glukkons are enslaving Mudokons, this time to produce a drink called Soulstorm Brew, which uses Mudokon bones and tears as its ingredients. The player assumes the role of Abe, embarking on a quest to halt production of SoulStorm Brew.

The game was released to similar critical acclaim as the first title. Reviews praised the game's ability to allow the player to quick save anywhere they liked, a feature that was not present in Abe's Oddysee, while noting that it was very similar to that title. The game won multiple awards upon release."

As part of the Official PlayStation Magazine, Vol. 41, the playable Crash Bash demo and Spyro: Year of the Dragon demo can make it easy to switch between PS1 games without having to get up out of a comfortable chair to change the demo disc in the PlayStation gaming system. Each demo version includes three levels of the official PS1 game. The bright orange label helps to keep track of the game disc so that a search does not have to occur by getting misplaced underneath a book, magazine, or paperwork after the disc is removed from the PS1. Crash Bash is a PlayStation game filled with battles, tournaments, and arena adventures. It is a struggle of good versus bad between two witch doctors. Aku Aku is the protector of all things good while Uka Uka is his evil brother. The characters of choice are Crash Bandicoot, Coco, Tiny, Dingodile, Dr. Neo Cortex, Dr. N. Brio, Koala Kong, and Rilla Roo. Crash Bandicoot’s speed, intelligence, and agility gives him the ability to conquer challenges quickly and efficiently. His sister, Coco, has inherited the same skill set and keeps close to her polar bear friend. Dingodile has a crocodile tail that is powerful enough to strike down opponents. Tiny is a tiger with a throwing force that saves the day. Dr. Neo Cortex sees the world as his own at all costs and uses his laser cannon tank to prove it. His partner, Dr. N. Brio, is unstoppable with his laser and his skill in long tank shots. Rilla Roo keeps to his own pace and attacks with unexpected force with his tail. Koala Kong was created by Dr. Neo Cortex, complete with kicking and throwing power that does not fail to hide his strength. In Spyro: Year of the Dragon, Spyro and his allies must find all the dragon eggs that the evil sorceress has stolen and hidden across multiple forgotten worlds. There are mini quests to complete, special skills to learn for challenges, and speedways for racing. Posts of accomplishments are recorded in the Atlas to help keep track of what has been completed and what remains. Even posts to keep count of gems earned can be found in the Atlas. As expected with an official PlayStation game, variety is a factor in the fun as game playing includes controlling Spyro and his allies from other worlds. Sheila the Kangaroo hops, jumps, kicks, and stomps to stay alive. Sergeant Byrd is a penguin that flies with air missiles on his shoulders. Bentley the Yeti carries a big club and uses it with success when necessary. Agent 9 is a lab monkey turned special operative with skills in laser blasters and explosives. You can play this Official PlayStation Magazine demo sampler of Crash Bash and Spyro: Year of the Dragon and share the experience with the PlayStation video game community through online posts or a favorite magazine. You can check for posts with follow up questions to send a message with any gaming results that need to be shared. You can send a message to friends who find enjoyment each time they receive a demo game disc that comes with the Official PlayStation Magazine. PlayStation demo discs can give a glimpse into what video game fun lies ahead. You can mix up a collection of PlayStation video games by adding the Crash Bash demo and Spyro: Year of the Dragon demo disc."

"Ogre Battle: The March of the Black Queen","Ogre Battle - Limited Edition","Region Not Set","","Atlus Co., Ltd.","Artdink","1996-09-27","1","No","Role-Playing | Strategy","E - Everyone","Twenty-five years ago Empress Endora conquered the entire continent of Zetegenia. Her reign proved to be tyrannical, and people of different social classes and positions began to long for a better future. Eventually, a resistance movement called the Liberation Army was formed. The protagonist (whose name and background are chosen by the player) takes command of the new army, and leads his allies towards a revolution.

Ogre Battle has elements of a real-time strategy game and a tactical RPG. The player manages a large army consisting of characters belonging to a vast amount of different classes. These classes include military specializations as well as mythological creatures such as dragons, angels, hellhounds, undead trees, etc. Each class its own unique characteristics and abilities in battle. For example, vampires and werewolves can only be deployed when the battle takes place during the night.

The player moves troops in real time on the tactical map. Individual battles between units are handled in a turn-based RPG style. The player is able to select general commands for the battle, as well as use powerful tarot cards for special techniques. Characters level up, change classes and grow stronger over the course of the game. The player can also purchase items in towns.

The protagonist's reputation is affected by the player's decisions during the storyline. The player can make choices that may prove to be popular or unpopular with the nation in contact with the Liberation Army. In addition, every character has his or her own alignment, ranging from good to evil. Liberating towns with evil characters may lower the army's reputation. These and other choices affect the plot's development and eventually lead to one of the thirteen possible endings."

In Oh No! you control a group of kids who are trying to get to the end of each stage without going hungry or getting killed. The boys run uncontrollably forward, either in a horizontal or vertical line; you can switch between the formations with the triangle button. To keep your health meter up, the boys must eat hamburgers lying on the ground. Avoid the fish sandwiches, though. They will deplete your health."

The wide spectrum of Olympic competition is covered in the game's 15 events. It's all there, from running and jumping, to swimming, shooting, and weight lifting. All of the events look realistic, thanks to motion-captured animation--you will see how athletes really jump over a seven-foot tall bar. And clearing that seven-foot hurdle will help you destroy the computer-controlled competition. However, it would be much more fun to smoke seven of your friends and rub their faces in your superiority as a virtual athlete.

"Paro Wars","パロウォーズ","Region Not Set","","Konami","Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo","1997-05-29","4","No","Role-Playing | Strategy","E - Everyone","Paro Wars is a turn-based strategy game that, as it turns out, as almost exactly like Military Madness (and even looks similar to that game's spiritual successor, Nintendo's Advance Wars.) You take control of one of 8 factions - which include Hikaru and her bunny girls, Pentarou and his horde of penguins, Takosuke Jr. and his octopi friends, Michael and his pigs, and Koitsu's army of paper airplanes. Other choices include the pandas, the moais, and a set of business suit-clad dogs. 

You're given a small map with limited resources - the object is to capture factories so you have the ability to make more units, which include a huge variety of tanks, planes and boats. Like Final Fantasy Tactics, the terrain is 3D modeled but the sprites are 2D. When you attack an opposing enemy, you get a goofy little (voiced) cutscene where your characters fight and taunt each other - they're pretty amusing, but can be skipped if you just want to play. There's even a cat who occasionally pops in to give some commentary on the battle situation. 

For a game that seems this lighthearted, there's an incredible amount of depth. Not only do you create vehicles, but you also have a vast array of unique characters to command each unit - also with their own stats. Unfortunately, at this point it all becomes a little overwhelming. Throughout the game, there are over seventy units, and while some have wacky names like ""Gaba Gaba Mk 3"", ""Go Go Saber"" and ""Mig-800DX!?"", others have more generic titles like ""Pu-25"", ""SM1573"" and ""T-Back 34/85"". Even if you know some Japanese - and God help you if you try to go this one without any knowledge of it - keeping track of everything is just too much. It doesn't help that a learning curve is entirely nonexistant."
"Parodius","","PAL","","Konami","Konami","1994-12-03","2","No","Shooter","E - Everyone","Gameplay is very similar to the Gradius series, with a few differences. Parodius retains the selectability of different weapons configurations but implements via four different characters: Vic Viper (from Gradius), Octopus, Twin Bee, and Pentarou. The second main difference is the addition of bell power-ups, from the Twinbee series. These bells act as one-time power-ups, allowing you to destroy every enemy on screen, fire huge beams of energy, etc. Enemies and environments from the Gradius games and Twinbee are mixed in along, with a host of anime-style opponents, which include scantily-clad women. All of the Gradius elements are integrated in a very light-hearted fashion. The Big Core, a regular boss within the Gradius series, is given a neon-look and is called ""Viva Core"". Moreover, there is a moai (Easter Island head statues) level, but all of the statues are given a much more animated look. The boss of that level, the Moai Head, fires other moai at the player by spitting them out of her mouth. The final boss, in typical Gradius fashion, is an unarmed enemy that once defeated, results in a destruction/escape sequence."

Taking place a few months after Innocent Sin, the game follows reporter Maya Amano as she investigates the Joker Curse, a malign phenomenon where people's wishes and rumors are coming true and causing chaos. During her investigations, she and others who join her gain the ability to summon Personas, personified aspects of their personalities. The gameplay features turn-based battle gameplay, where characters use their Personas in battle against demons, and a separate Rumor system, where rumors spread around the city can influence events in the characters' favor, either bad or good.

Halfway through the production of Innocent Sin, writer Tadashi Satomi felt that a fresh point of view was needed in addition to Tatsuya, laying the groundwork for Eternal Punishment. The original producer (Kouji Okada), character designer (Kazuma Kaneko) and composers (Toshiko Tasaki, Kenichi Tsuchiya and Masaki Kurokawa) returned alongside Satomi. The second game began development after Innocent Sin was completed, and while it reused most of the assets from Innocent Sin, the gameplay and Rumor system were improved upon. The game's theme song, ""Change Your Way"", was written by English singer-songwriter Elisha La'Verne based on the game's premise. Reception of the game in Japan and the west has generally been positive, with reviewers appreciating improvements over Innocent Sin, the plot, the gameplay systems, and the improved localization compared to the original Persona."

Some old obstacles and enemies appear, such as tar pits that can open up beneath Harry and swallow him whole, ever-present scorpions, and old favorites like rolling logs and handy vines, which can be found smattered around the jungle. But there are new dangers as well, including the sinister flying darters, and new wonders to behold, such as gravity-defying lucense.

Harry Jr. gets by much the same way his father did -- he can dodge out of the way, jump over obstacles, and take a swing at attackers with his trusty pick-axe. The object is to guide Harry Jr. through 11 levels, trying to discover what happened to the Moku civilization, and finally into a confrontation with the mighty Scourge, who's holding this alternate dimension hostage. Oh, and Harry might want to grab some treasure along the way too -- just like dear old Dad."

"Planet Dob","","NTSC-J","Japan","Hudson Entertainment, Inc.","Microvision","1999-11-18","1","No","Adventure | Puzzle","Not Rated","DOB is a Japanese Future Project combines many different Music Styles ranging from Ambient, Indie, Pop to Drum'n'Bass (sometimes in one song). Their album 'La Lu La Roo' (1996) comes as a CD-Enhanced (CD-Audio and CD-Rom). Recently they invented their own game for the Sony Playstation called 'Planet Dob'.

An alien flying above Earth gets knocked unconscious after his ship crashes while avoiding a giant net. Scientists strap his passed out frame on a table and send a very unwilling subject (his glasses are shaped in the letters Y-O-U) into his mind to see what makes him tick.

The absolutely whacked-out result is Planet Dob, one of the strangest and coolest games on any console. Part adventure, part puzzle, part music, and completely inspired musically. The visuals mix pre-rendered backgrounds, 3D elements, and CG characters, and are full of vibrant colors that pop, swirl and spin.

The ""plot"" spells itself out as you play in loads of Japanese text, but there are so many visual cues and English signage that it's not too difficult to play. The ""Super Lounging Music"" is almost too relaxing;""Oh yes, It's like no gravity, dippily, Super relaxing and Lounging kind of sound"", according to one of the two fold out manuals included. But the frantic, hysterical urgency of some of the mini-games and the ""Mixing Hour"" stages (where you play around with music from the game) will keep you glued to your tee vee for days."
"Planet Laika","","NTSC-J","Japan","Enix Corporation","Quintet","1999-10-21","1","No","Adventure | Role-Playing","Not Rated","Planet Laika is a console role-playing game developed by Quintet and Zeque. The game was only released in Japan. The game follows the main character, Laika, through a mission to Mars which forces the player to manipulate Laika's multiple-personality disorder in order to solve puzzles. All the characters in the game have dog heads, a possible reference to the Russian space dog Laika.

The story begins as the crew of a rocket ship heads to Mars on a mission to find out the truth behind rumors about the ""end of the world"" and the existence of an unknown supernatural being. All the characters in the game have dog faces, and you learn at one point that mankind was once destroyed for having human faces. Mars is controlled by a force called the ""Evil Mind,"" which manipulates the inhabitants of the planet, changing them into one of three colors and personality types. The people who are colored yellow are visually focused and pursue physical beauty. The reds are animalistic and strong, and they resort to violence quickly. The blues are psychotic but also quite crafty. The planet plays tricks on their minds, causing them to see illusions, including an illusion of the crew of the ship.

A major theme of the game is Laika's different personalities, embodied by three different characters, Ernest, Yolanda, and Spacer. By talking to different characters, Laika absorbs their different colored auras and whena specific color has been absorbed enough, Laika can turn into that personality to solve a problem, such as needing Ernest, the strongest, to lift a heavy shutter.

Unlike most RPG's, which feature turn-based battles, Planet Laika's are played out almost like Space Invaders and Pong. The player must bounce around a Mind Core and reflect back the enemies attacks to inflict damage. There are not a lot of battles in the game and enemies only attack when Laika is in one of the special forms."

"Play Stadium","","NTSC-J","Japan","Banpresto Co., Ltd.","Banpresto","1996-04-12","1","No","Sports","Not Rated","Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players. The aim is to score runs by hitting a thrown ball with a bat and touching a series of four bases arranged at the corners of a ninety-foot diamond. Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to stop them from scoring runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team can stop at any of the bases and later advance via a teammate's hit or other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn at bat for each team constitutes an inning and nine innings make up a professional game. The team with the most runs at the end of the game wins. 

Baseball is one of the most popular sports in Japan. It was introduced to Japan in 1872 by Horace Wilson, who taught at the Kaisei School in Tokyo. The first baseball team was called the Shimbashi Athletic Club and was established in 1878. Baseball has been a popular sport ever since.

Players are rated in 18 attributes (plus some hidden attributes), and eight formations. Several tactics give the manager a lot of depth to change into the style more suitable for the footballers available . As there isn't a stat to display the overall value of a player (other than his market value), the player has to choose the starting eleven according to the desired playing style by their individual strengths: defenders with strong heading should be placed in the middle, fast dribblers in the flanks and so on, as well as using the post-match analysis statistics to see how well they performed.

Like the older titles, the games uses the Kick Off engine to simulate games, in this case Kick Off 97. Other match simulation options include a 2D radar (which can quickly change to the 3D engine in key parts of the game such as goals and cards) and a CM-like text mode. 

If two players want to discover who has the strongest team, they can do so by choosing the ""Friendly"" mode. This allows to import team data from the floppy drive, and play a dream match between them"

Categorized by Sony as a miniature personal digital assistant, the device features a monochrome liquid crystal display (LCD), infrared communication capability, a real-time clock, built-in flash memory, and a sound capability. Connecting to a PlayStation through a memory card slot, the PocketStation also functions as a PlayStation memory card. It was released exclusively in Japan on January 23, 1999.

Software for the PocketStation was typically distributed as extras for PlayStation games, included in the CD-ROM, enhancing the games with added features. Stand-alone software could also be downloaded through the PlayStation console. The software is then transferred to the PocketStation for use. A built-in infrared data interface allows direct transfer of data such as game saves between PocketStation units, as well as multiplayer gaming.

The original Japanese ship date for the PocketStation was set for December 23, 1998, but it was delayed a full month. Sony only shipped an initial 60,000 units of the peripheral when it was released on January 23, 1999. It was initially available in two case colors: white and clear. It proved extremely popular, selling out all over the region. Sony planned to release the PocketStation outside of Japan, engaging in promotional activity in Europe and North America, but the release did not occur. SCEA cited an inability meeting Japanese demand as the reason for the PocketStation's absence. A few games, such as Final Fantasy VIII and SaGa Frontier 2, retained PocketStation functionality in their localized versions.

The PocketStation's most popular game was Dokodemo Issho, which sold over 1.5 million copies in Japan and is the first game to star Sony's mascot Toro. The PocketStation was discontinued in July 2002 after having shipped nearly five million units.

Pocket Dungeon is a RPG game in which the player fight battles with monsters that he has captured during the Pocketstation game. The main game that is played in the PocketStation is a first person perspective RPG in which the player takes the role of a young hero that begins his quest in a town where he can go around and talk to the town people and after that he can go to the dungeons to fight the monsters.

The PSX game features a gallery where the player can view all the monsters that he defeat in the main game.

Every year, the game is released around late September and/or early October with two different titles: World Soccer: Winning Eleven in Japan, and Pro Evolution Soccer in other countries. The Japanese version is a localized version that features local leagues. In 2007, the franchise began to use the name Winning Eleven: Pro Evolution Soccer for the American market, which was later changed to Pro Evolution Soccer in 2008, dropping the Winning Eleven moniker entirely for that region.

Partially as a result of EA Sports' affinity to purchasing exclusive rights for their FIFA series, the games have historically lacked the sheer volume of licenses present in EA's offerings, with the most notable absences being the Premier League and Bundesliga. As such, team jerseys, names, and players may be inaccurate.

Portuguese player Cristiano Ronaldo, who plays his club football for Real Madrid, was the face of the franchise, appearing on the front cover from 2012 to 2013. He has since been replaced by Mario Götze for 2015, then he was replaced by Neymar and Álvaro Morata for 2016, then he was replaced by Aya Miyama for 2017 to present.

As of December 2011, the Pro Evolution Soccer franchise has been localized into 19 languages and available in 62 countries. As of December 2012, the series have been sold more than 81.65 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling video game franchises.[1][2]"

As the story goes, some evil magical entity has stolen the keys of time for the towns in Radishland, freezing time and turning every animal and creature into evil magical contraptions. Only Zac and Mel, empowered with their ""invented magic sticks"" are able to escape the curse and must thread through Radishland turning all the monsters back into their original form and recovering the keys of time.

Gameplay-wise the game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up in which you control your character in a 2.5D isometric plane as he clears each stage by beating the many wacky enemies with his stick and a few magic spells that are randomly selected whenever you start the game. At the end of each stage there is a harder ""boss"" creature you must defeat and upon doing so you proceed to the next stage.

The game is notable for its surreal graphic design, featuring digitized graphics merged with hand-drawn sprites and featuring mostly colorful nonsensical graphics. Features single player or co-op two-player gameplay modes."

The field is small, surrounded by a hip-height board players can use to bounce the ball. The rules are simple: the game starts like in basketball, with the ball being dropped between the two forwards in midfield. The rest of the game is very freeform, with fouls being awarded for awkward challenges (Penalties are given if the attacking player is on the break) and throw-ins (scored with the feet) if the ball goes above the boards. The player can select the tactics - from the three field players (the goalkeeper can't leave the goal area), it's possible to pay more offensively (with 2 in front and 1 in the back) or defensively (2 in back and 1 in front). While the real tournament was traditionally played on public parks and car lots, the game version includes these and more exotic settings, such as an airport, a ships' deck or in the middle of a city crossroad. The grand finals are always played inside an indoor arena.

After a team manages a number of shots, they are entitled to three ""supershots"", which are much more powerful and swerve a lot more than regular shots. The three shots, if well used, can turn a game upside down in a matter of seconds or mean the team will have to do a lot to make up for them if spoiled. While building up the Supershot gauge, the player has to rely on well placed shots, header, volleys, bicycle kicks or moving the ball in attack very quickly to score."

"Puyo Puyo Box","ぷよぷよBOX","Region Not Set","","Compile","Compile","2000-12-21","4","No","Puzzle","E - Everyone","This is a compilation game consisting of modes from previous Puyo Puyo games. It is Compile's last recognized Puyo Puyo title in the series before Sega obtained the rights.
Puyo Puyo Box, being a compilation, primarily consists of modes from earlier Puyo Puyo games, but also contains original content.

This game has a plethora of game modes available to the user. It contains ports of ""Puyo Puyo"" and ""Puyo Puyo 2"", as well as a RPG-styled quest mode in which the player plays as Arle and battles against members of the other cast in Puyo Puyo matches. It also houses a ""Stage Clear"" mode in which you have to face either 10, 20, or 30 opponents, as well as two multiplayer modes which can be played with either other players or AI substitutes.

For the Quest mode itself, it allowed the player to customize the armory in ways in which made Arle stronger with a double-edged sword effect. You could remove the Puyo Rings in order to beef up her attack at the expense of being unable to see your next pieces for example, and the amount of experience gained and gold won was relative to how big a chain was scored and how quickly the opponent was defeated.

The key point in the Puyo Puyo gameplay of Box is that the player can choose a ruleset from either ""Puyo Puyo"", ""Puyo Puyo 2"", ""Puyo Puyo Sun"" and ""Puyo Puyo~n"". This can effectively lead to 4-player battles where each player plays with independent or mixed rules. This game also allowed for team battles to take place. A special multiplayer mode was made available in this game, known as ""Treasure Mode"", which was adapted in ""Puyo Puyo! 15th Anniversary"" as its ""Excavation Mode""."
"Puyo Puyo Sun Ketteiban","Puyo Puyo Sun - Definitive Edition | ぷよぷよSUN 決定版","Region Not Set","","Compile","Compile","1997-11-27","2","No","Puzzle","E - Everyone","This game is a Japan-only port of the third game in the Puyo Puyo series originally made for the Arcades by Sega.

The name of Puyo Puyo Sun comes from a Japanese pun on ""san"", and also indicates a new Ojama brought into the game. As Sun Puyos were used in this game, and the game itself is not only set on a tropical beach, but is the third in the series (?, ""san"" is the Japanese word for the number 3), the name suited the game. 

Just like the predecessors, Puyos fall from the top of the screen in pairs, can be moved left and right, and can be rotated clockwise and anti-clockwise by 90°. The rule of Sousai and Zenkesei still remained, but every time you countered, special garbage would fall on the screen in a preset pattern (in the Game Boy version of this game, it fell randomly). Every time you cleared the screen however, Sun Puyos would fall on the screen, and the All Clear bonus removed.

The game features 3 story modes featuring their own character and difficulty: Draco Centauros (Easy), Arle Nadja (Normal) and Schezo Wegey (Hard).

Storyline: 
Satan has once again decided to create another test by using special magic to pull the Sun closer to the Earth on a remote island. This created a semi-resort, in which characters have decided to visit. Arle, together with Carbuncle, find the sun too hot, and see the building that Satan's emanating his own heat wave. Draco loves the hot weather and appears in a bikini, whereas Schezo, who takes refuge in a cave, finds that it's just not cool enough, and decides to find out what's happening."

Continuing the trend of naming the games after puns, the name comes from a pun on ""yon"", the Japanese word for the number 4, but this time this is the only reference to the pun.

The gameplay in is similar to that of Puyo Puyo 2, but adds super attacks. Clearing chains now builds up a ""charge meter"" which allows players to use them. The only other addition was a new game mode which could be played with a number of different field sizes, smaller or bigger than the standard 6x12, however, it removes several game modes that were present in Puyo Puyo Sun, i.e. the tournament, task and chain training modes. The art is also vastly different to the previous game in the series and, of course, the Fever series; this style was only otherwise used for Minna de Puyo Puyo.

STORY: 
Satan has released an odd demon called Pierott. Pierott invites Arle and Carbuncle over to the “Puyo Puyo Circus”. All seemed to be just fine, Arle and Carbuncle went into a tent to watch a magic show, but Satan had Carbuncle volunteer for a magic trick he was doing. A magic trick? Or a trap? He puts Carbuncle on the stand, and casts a spell, which makes Carbuncle, disappear! Arle wasn't worried, she didn't even know what was going on, but later on, she couldn't find Carbuncle anywhere! She then has to start battling monsters and oddball characters in a match of Puyo Puyo to try to reach Satan, and get Carbuncle back!"

A vous d'escalader la pyramide des gains et d'utiliser vos jokers à bon escient pour décrocher le pactole. Retrouvez l'ambiance de l'émission télé avec son animateur vedette vous posant les questions qui fâchent.

Who Wants To Be A Millionaire is the videogame version of the popular TV game show that is currently sweeping the world. The aim of the game is to correctly answer consecutive questions to win progressively more money - get one wrong though, and your out..!

For those of you that have seen the show on TV (and at this point who hasn't?) one of the things that really helps to build the tension of this game is the music. The good news is that the same score is included in this game. As you work your way up the questions, the music gets more dramatic and really helps to build that anticipation that goes along with each question. The music definitely gets a thumbs up for what it accomplishes.

We are also treated to various quips and banter throughout the game by the presenter, but unfortunately he doesn't actually read off the questions.

On the graphics side of the house.well let me just say, this is gonna be a real short read for you folks.

The actual set of the TV is a true spectacle in terms of lighting, display and overall interactivity between the contestant, the host and the audience. Everything works perfectly. Unfortunately this just has not been translated very well to the home console version. About the best way to describe the graphics in Millionaire is ""sterile"". What we see are the questions as they would be viewed through the contestants monitor and a split screen view of the stage.devoid of all life. The flash and substance of the TV show is completely lost here.

Playing Millionaire is simplicity itself.Players are given the opportunity to win a million by correctly answering 15 multiple choice questions that increase in difficulty as the amounts rise. Players are given the question and must choose from four possible answers. To help players further, they are given 3 lifelines:
- Lifeline #1 called the 50:50 allows for two of the incorrect answers to be eliminated leaving one wrong answer and of course the right one.
- Lifeline #2 is called ""Ask The Audience"". Here the game developers reveal the results of a poll of 100 people. There is no guarantee that the most popular answer is correct, but it can be of great help to confirm your suspicions.
- Lifeline #3 called ""Phone-A-Friend"". This time you call someone that may know the correct answer to the question. Again this is all simulated by the computer and occasionally the person asked will give the wrong or no answer at all.

That's about it.as you progress up to higher monetary amounts the questions increase in difficulty. It is really amusing to watch as people begin to doubt themselves and panic as they reach the 32,000 plus level. It is not uncommon to see someone go totally brain dead and use all of their lifelines on a single question.and still not feel comfortable enough to give a final answer!"

However, one band in particular apparently didn't get the memo - the Japanese group ""R"", who have come to America to perform in Los Angeles.

R: Rock'n Riders otherwise known as simply R is a snowboard simulation game in which four of the six members of the rock band ""R"" must board their way across the Western United States in order to make it to their gig in Los Angeles.

To do this, the player must perform different types of tricks, grab (and attempt to hold on to) musical instruments, and avoid getting hit or falling down in order to score points. Scoring points also improves the quality of the in-game music, which begins each stage in an incomplete and virtually non-existent state.

After each stage (except the fourth and final) is complete, the player can view a replay accompanied by music.

In addition, players can access the ""Music room"" to see the characters playing their instrument, and after they complete the game with all four playable characters, they can access the ""Extra Game"", in which the band members must battle seven opponents - not just with their speed, but with their punching skills."

"Rakugaki Showtime","ラクガキショータイム","Region Not Set","","Enix Corporation","Treasure","1999-07-29","2","No","Fighting","E - Everyone","Rakugaki Showtime is a game along the same vein as Poitter's Point (Also known as Poy Poy )where in you try to defeat the opponents by throwing things at them. 

STORY: 
Welcome to the world of Rakugaki. An imaginary game world, created entirely by the pencil drawings of the ""God Hand"". The characters who inhabit this world were created by the God Hand in the same way... Yukiwo, Sasami, Pitanand Tsubohachi; the four members of the ""Heroes Team"", and Daddy; who commands the mysterious enemy character army. 

Called the ""Heroes and Enemies"", they are all controlled by their master, and follow their predetermined (created?) fate. Today a battle to the end unfolds... 

GAMEPLAY: 
Rakugaki Showtime you play as a rakugaki (scribble) character, who must fight against other rakugaki characters in a square 3D arena. The fights mainly consist of throwing items at the opposition. However, throwing is not as simple as ""pick up, aim & throw"". In Rakugaki Showtime different ""drives"" can be placed on the thrown items by holding different directions whilst throwing. Holding the direction towards the target will cause a ""Forward Drive Throw"", which is like a faster normal throw, albeit weaker. Holding the direction away from the target will cause you to do a ""Backward Drive Throw"", which will cause your character to throw the item slower and in an arc, but it will cause far more damage. 

By performing a ""Counter"", you are able to block most items thrown at you. If your timing is off, the Item will just bounce off you and drop down. But if you ""Counter"" just before the item hits you, your character will perform a ""Donpisha Counter"" (Donpisha means to trigger immediately), which causes the item to be reflected back at the original thrower. 

One of the more important items in the game is a Smiley Ball. Unlike all other items, Smiley Balls will not be destroyed after use. Instead, every impact will slowly make the Smiley Ball go from yellow to magenta, from happy to angry. After it gets very angry, a sound clip of ""halleluja"" will play and the Smiley will be engulfed in flashing white light... it has become a Super Smiley. When you pick up a Super Smiley, you will not throw it. Instead, your rakugaki will unleash their ""Super Smiley Attack"", which in most cases is devestating. Also, your fighter may be able to use different Super Smiley Attack's by applying different drives, these are called Forward Super Smileys and the Backward Drive Super Smileys. 

Like every other fighting game that has ever existed, you can execute Special Moves. These usually consist of very basic button commands involving the directional buttons and generally the Circle button. Some characters have a whole arsenal of Special Moves, others only have only a handful. 

Around the stages are ""Item Points"", these are where the God Hand will draw the Items to be used in battle. You can make your character move to these points quickly by performing a ""Homing Dash"". To do this, jump, hold the direction you want to go and then hit the jump button again. You will fly over to the point you indicated. As well as item points, you can use a ""Homing Dash"" to quickly fly over to Smiley Balls, this is EXTREMELY helpful. You are also able to ""Chain Homing Dashes"", to do this, just hold the jump button down after doing a Homing Dash, and tap the direction of another item point before you land. You can cancel Homing Dashes mid-flight by pressing the Circle Button. 

GAME MODES: 
- Normal Mode: In this mode, you battle enemies in set stages. The difficulty differs depending on your performance, where doing badly (i.e. losing two times in arow) nets you crappy characters (e.g. Zacko) whereas doing well rewards youwith really good characters. At first you will only be able to play as Yukiwo, Sasami, Pitan and Tsubohachi, but everytime you complete the game you will unlock another character. There are 12 stages you must battle through, ending with a final rumble against the God Hand. 
- Versus Mode: In versus mode, you can battle to other three players or computer rtvals. 
- Training Mode: Here you select a character to fight against a Zacko who has an absurd amount of life and hardly enough brain cells to fill a pore on the human face. This isgood to test out damage for the different moves of your character. The missions are as follows: 1) Use the Smiley Ball 2) Use Items 3) Test your skills. 

CHARACTERS: 
- Yukiwo: Yukiwo is the standard well-rounded protagonist. He has an above averageamount of health, at 3928 HP. His running speed is Fairly Fast, and his Homing Dash speed is pretty Average. 
- Sasami: Sasami is a very agile fighter.she's skilled in the Kung Fu Arts. Both her running and Homing Dash speeds are Fast, which will allow her to run rings against most of the opposition. She is fairly ""light-weight"" though, only having 2333 HP. She only has a couple of Special Moves, and they are all pretty weak. 
- Pitan: Pitan is a cute mischievous monk, who speaks in Kansai Ben.. He has 3001 HP, his running speed is Fast,and his Homing Dash speed is Fairly Fast. Apart from being speedy, Pitan's greatest advantage over the others are his highly useful Super Smiley Attacks. 
- Tsubohachi: Tsubohachi is Pitan's unruly drunk of a father. He is constantly referred to as ""OYAJI"", which is somewhat Japanese slang for ""My Old Man"", ""Geezer"", etc. Tsubohachi is one of the most enjoyable characters to play as. Whilst your controlling him, he won'tfollow your commands 100% correctly, which gives you the feeling of playing as a drunk. It's a brilliant touch to this character. Tsubohachi has a very decent amount of health, at 4802 HP, and his running and Homing Dash speed are both very random. Relying on whether your pushing against or with the way he's staggering."

Rampage World Tour starts off at Scumlabs International where three lab technicians, George, Lizzy, and Ralph have mutated in an accident involving toxic waste. George has turned into a gigantic ape, Lizzy a gigantic lizard or dinosaur, and Ralph some sort of gigantic wolf. The three destroy the lab they previously worked at and then embark on a path of destruction encompassing the entire globe.

The player chooses one of these three characters and begins destroying buildings, eating civilians, knocking planes out of the sky, and stepping on tanks. The ultimate goal of the game is to rid the world of Scumlabs by traveling to the cities where they are located. Being creatures of such massive size, there are many cities that must be destroyed along the way. Scumlabs and the various militaries make it a priority to destroy you and optionally another player that can play simultaneously.

The graphics are worth noting as they are of a unique, colorful ""cartoon"" flavor. Gameplay includes players climbing buildings while punching, kicking, and eating their inhabitants to destroy them. Once all the buildings for a particular stage have been destroyed, the stage is clear and players proceed to the next stage.

The game's plot follows Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine, members of an elite task force known as S.T.A.R.S., as they investigate the outskirts of Raccoon City following the disappearance of their team members. They soon become trapped in a mansion infested with zombies and other monsters. The player, having selected to play as Chris or Jill at the start of the game, must explore the mansion to uncover its secrets.
Conceived by producer Tokuro Fujiwara as a remake of his earlier horror game Sweet Home (1989), the development of Resident Evil was led by Shinji Mikami. It went through several redesigns, initially conceived as a Super NES game in 1993, then as a fully 3D first-person PlayStation game in 1994, and then finally a third-person game with pre-rendered backdrops. Gameplay consists largely of third-person action with added emphasis on inventory management, exploration, and puzzle solving. Resident Evil establishes many conventions seen later in the series, including the control scheme, inventory system, save system, and use of 3D models superimposed over pre-rendered backgrounds.
Resident Evil was very well received critically and commercially, and is often credited for defining the survival horror genre. Beyond video games, Resident Evil has been credited with re-popularising zombies in mainstream popular culture from the late 1990s onwards (along with The House of the Dead), leading to a renewed interest in zombie films during the 2000s. Resident Evil has since been hailed as one of the greatest video games of all time. Its success has spawned a multimedia franchise including video games, films, comics, novels, and other merchandise. The game has received dedicated ports to the Sega Saturn, Microsoft Windows, and Nintendo DS. In 2002, a remake of the same name was released for the GameCube featuring updated graphics, sound, and changes to the gameplay and story. A high-definition remaster of the GameCube game was released in 2015 for modern platforms. A sequel, Resident Evil 2, was released in 1998, and a prequel, Resident Evil Zero, in 2002.

The Value Series edition of Resident Evil was part of a re-release of 12 Classic PS1 games in the year 2000 in PAL regions only."

Survivor's gameplay is a combination of first-person shooter and arcade-style light gun game. The player views the environment from the perspective of the character (first person view) and moves the character through the environment with the controller. At the same time, if the player wishes to attack an enemy or destroy an object, they press a button which allows them to control a crosshair on the screen. This crosshair can be moved to any location within the main character's line of sight. Using the G-Con 45, players move around by shooting off screen to move and the side buttons to turn, and point at the screen to shoot enemies.

The game borrows its enemies from Resident Evil 2, featuring the zombie models from that game, as well as creatures such as Lickers, the Ivy plants, Moth Giants and Tyrants. In addition, Survivor also reintroduces the original Hunters from the first Resident Evil and features two new enemies in the form of the Umbrella Trashsweeper unit – soldiers armed with machine guns – and the Hypnos T-Type, a new Tyrant model that evolves into different forms. The player's arsenal consists almost entirely of pistols, such as the Glock 17 and the CZ75. As the protagonist progresses through the game, the player receives larger weapons to aid in defending against ever more dangerous opposition while they make their way through Umbrella's ruined city and shadowy research labs. The game features branching paths that allow the player to determine how the story will unfold and whom they will meet along the way."

Happy Resident Evil 25th Anniversary! On March 22nd 1996, Capcom released in Japan the first game with the “Survival Horror” tag on the PlayStation: Biohazard, released a week later in
the West as Resident Evil. The game was a major success, selling over 2.75 million copies at the time.

Sadly, Resident Evil suffered from some questionable censorship. One year later, in 1997, the game received a Director’s Cut update, with many additions, including “the complete uncut
and uncensored Resident Evil cinemas”, as stated on the back of the case. The latter was however false, allegedly due to a manufacturing error. So, when Capcom decided to re-release the
game for a third time in 1998, featuring DualShock support and an orchestrated soundtrack, one could think that they finally fixed this issue, right? Wrong.

This simple project aims to restore content from the various releases of the game, such as the Beta, Trial, or original Japanese versions, including:

- The original uncut FMVs from the Japanese version, alongside the full-color opening scene from the French and German Director’s Cut release.
- The Mansion’s Bathroom from the 01/31/1996 Beta version, which allows you to grab an extra Clip after unplugging the Water in Jill’s scenario.
- The Mansion's 2nd Floor Right Stairs wall message in blood, from the Japanese Trial Edition of the game.
- The Mansion's 2nd Floor Main Hall unknown music track, in the scene when Jill meets Barry again (""it's reeaally powerful""), sourced from the 01/31/1996 Beta version (only on Easy and
  Original modes)."

It inserts the original soundtrack back from “Resident Evil” in “Resident Evil: Director’s Cut”, meaning you get the DualShock features without the DualShock soundtrack.
 The original, uncut, full-color FMVs have been inserted. They’re higher quality than the original black and white ones, too.
A new Deranged Mode replaces Arrange Mode, which condenses the Spencer Mansion while making it a much more difficult experience.
A second disc is included that replicates the Sega Saturn exclusive Battle Mode, as well as including a new Maze Mode that turns the mansion into a nonviolent labyrinth. Choose the wrong door and it’s back to the start for you.
There is one small bug that was never fixed: on Jill’s route, if you get poisoned by the Yawn, a cutscene triggers of her waking up in the infirmary save room. Should this happen, a small room with candles you have to use the Lighter on will instead warp you inside the Garden’s shed without needing to collect any Crests. As the candle room doesn’t have any plot significant items, it can be safely ignored if the Yawn poisons Jill.
Little bit of history:

The original Resident Evil came out in the west with censored black and white intro and cut-scenes. The Director’s Cut version was supposed to fix that but Capcom developers made a mistake and forgot to include the uncensored FMV (Full motion Video), I'm not kidding go read the wiki.

So they made a third a version! Director’s Cut Dual Shock Ver. This time with uncensored FMV, right? RIGHT?! Wrong. This version still comes censored, but is compatible with Dual Shock controllers and they changed the entire OST with a really awkward one known as one of the worst in gaming history."

Unlike the previous games in the Zork franchise, which were text adventures, Return to Zork takes place from a first-person perspective and makes use of video-captured actors as well as detailed graphics; a point-and-click interface replaced the text parser for the first time in a Zork game. The overall gameplay style was somewhat similar to Myst, although Return to Zork predated Myst by a few months. Unlike Myst, which had no extraspatial dimensions of functionality, Return to Zork featured multiple ways of interacting with each object in the game world, as well as with several non-player characters also present in the world via a menu which appeared on the left side of the screen.

Among the actors who appeared in the game were a number of instantly recognizable (by face, if not necessarily by name) character actors as well as a number of well-known younger actors: Robyn Lively of Twin Peaks as ""The Fairy"", Jason Hervey of The Wonder Years as ""The Troll King"", and Sam J. Jones from the 1980 film Flash Gordon as ""The Blind Bowman"" and A.J. Langer of My So-Called Life as fellow Zork explorer Rebecca Snoot whom the player encounters on several occasions.

According to the myth, the Great Underground Empire of Zork was destroyed and all evil magic was dispersed. But now, the IT&L Corporation claimes to have discovered the mythical dark recesses beneath the Valley of the Sparrows.

The NON, with their vampish commander Mistress Helga (portrayed by Kerri Hoskins), have declared war on youth culture (anyone aged from 13 to 30) and have banned music, television and video games as well as magazines and are stricly forbidden.

It stars three eight-year-old girls, Mao, Misora and Sylvia, as they try to defend the earth against invading aliens. The world's defense has fallen to unlikely straits because the aliens are excessively cute, of which combat engagements are televised: if the forces battling the aliens were not cute themselves, the general public would revolt, as it would be seen as ""bullying"". Consequently, three military leaders chose their granddaughters to be the defenders, fittingly, becoming a team even cuter than the aliens. They each have a clover-shaped badge that enables them to transform. (This transformation provides no apparent special ability.)

The series itself is rife with parodies and references, particularly to Akamatsu's earlier work Love Hina. The girls' commanding officer bears a resemblance to Naru Narusegawa from Love Hina. See also below in the characters, and anime episode 20, manga chapters 17 and 25.

The game is a mix of an adventure and a simulation game with japanese voice acting and some mini games to advance in the game or improve the character stats."

For those who have not played the original, you are competing against thirteen other ""Road Rashers"" who will stop at nothing to win 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. During the race, you have two options available to you: you can either do your best to cross the finish line, or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if they are giving you trouble. If you do the latter, your opponents will do the same to you during the next race that takes place.

There are five circuits to race: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Some of these circuits are dangerous. As well as the obstacles and traffic that you encounter along the way, there are also cops driving on bikes who will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop your bike near them, and you have to pay a fine in order to get in any more races. Your bike will be wrecked if you crash too many times, and you have to pay for damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are riding. Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again another four times - but at a much more difficult level. Manage to win all five circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash cup.

There are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups. Rat, Sport, and Super. You start the first level with a Rat bike, but as you proceed through the levels, it is important to pick bikes from a different bike class."

The programming segment premiered in 1992. The show was part of BKN's drive to reinvent itself. The show's premise was that aliens had been living among humans for ages, and were the origins of many of the creatures humans know from myth, folklore and legends, including vampires and werewolves.

On the show, the Roswell UFO Incident which is part of a conspiracy theory (that many real life people still hold to this day) is portrayed as being a man made phenomenon. It was set up by humans to deflect popular attention from the truth. The unidentified flying object was a prop; the body of a little green or grey man was a dummy; the witnesses to the crash were plants; as were the Air Force investigators. In fact the whole shadow world surrounding Area 51 was nothing but a distraction from the fact that the aliens had landed long ago and there were known incidents of their desire to attack, assimilate and/or destroy the human race."

The Japanese name, Tsukuru, is a pun mixing the Japanese word tsukuru, which means ""make"" or ""create"", with tsuru, the Japanese transcription of the English word ""tool"". 

The RPG Maker series has been released primarily in Japan, with later versions also released in East Asia, North America, Europe, and Australia. 

RPG Tsukuru 4, for the PlayStation 1, was the only one in the series of console games not localized for the USA. RPG Tsukuru 4 was the sequel to our RPG Maker 1, but it stayed in Japan. Sprites now had their own portraits for dialogue and the sprites themselves were much more detailed. The best changes though were the battle system and the addition of variables and timers. Scripting and events are seperated like in RPG Maker 2, and variables show up for the first time in a console RPG Maker. There are 126 selectable enemies, counting the slots for custom enemies. 

The game's second disk contained an enhanced Anime Maker, where players could meticulously create frames and even more frames for their custom sprite characters.

"Saikyou Ginsei Shogi 2","","NTSC-J","Japan","","","2022-10-24","2","No","Board","Not Rated","Igo or Go, known as wéiqí in Chinese and baduk in Korean, is an ancient board game for two players that originated in China more than 2,000 years ago. The game is noted for being rich in strategy despite its relatively simple rules.

The game is played by two players who alternately place black and white stones on the vacant intersections of a grid of 19×19 lines. Once placed on the board, stones cannot be moved elsewhere, unless they are surrounded and captured by the opponent's stones. The object of the game is to secure (surround) a larger portion of the board than the opponent. When a game concludes, the controlled spaces are counted to determine which portion is the largest, as exact territory size is not easily apparent during play. Games may also be won by resignation, if for example one side has suffered a severe tactical loss (too many stones captured, etc.).

Placing stones close together helps them support each other and avoid capture; on the other hand, placing stones far apart creates influence across more of the board. Part of the strategic difficulty of the game stems from finding a balance between such conflicting interests. Players strive to serve both defensive and offensive purposes and choose between tactical urgency and strategic plans. At its basis, the game is one of simple logic, while in advanced play the game involves complex heuristics and tactical analysis.

Go originated in ancient China sometime before the 3rd century BC (exactly when is unknown), by which time it was already a popular pastime, as indicated by a reference to the game in the Analects of Confucius. Archaeological evidence shows that the early game was played on a board with a 17×17 grid, but by the time that the game spread to Korea and Japan in about the 5th and 7th centuries respectively, the boards with a 19×19 grid had become standard.

The game is most popular in East Asia. In fact, 10% of all Koreans (North and South) play go, the highest percentage of all countries in the world. A conservative estimate places the number of Go players worldwide at approximately 27 million. Go reached the West through Japan, which is why it is commonly known internationally by its Japanese name.

Sekai Saikyou Ginsei Igo 2 is the second game in the igo game series for the Playstation released by Silver Star that features japanese voice and a challenge difficulty level."

SD Gundam G-Century is a strategic game which focuses on resource management, planning ahead, and eliminating other competitors. It is a turn-based game system with hex-gridded maps, fixed-location factories, revenue generating space-colonies and cities (where number depends on terrain map), and units that gain experience and ability over time. Additions to the standard game formula include the ability to upgrade or downgrade the suit or ship a pilot is flying, to trade in the vehicle for another, and to rename the pilot.

There are over 100 terrain maps based in space, on the Earth, and on the Moon; 150 SD mobile suits and ships including the Blue Destiny from the Saturn GUNDAM GAIDEN series; 14 factions plus 4 design-your-own custom faction; 5 game modes; 25 long and short CD music tracks; and the 4 player action contained in previous versions.

The opening screen leads to the menu screen with the following choices:
- Scenario Mode: Gives you a chance to play all the scenarios from the GUNDAM storylines from Universal Century (UC) 0079 Odessa Operation of MSG Movie #1 to After Colony (AC) 0195 Libra Operation in Gundam Wing.

- Single Mode: Lets you play one particular scenario in one terrain map in space, on the Earth, or on the Moon.

- World Mode: Lets you play one scenario on your selection of three terrain maps of space, Earth, and Moon.

- Century Mode: Appears to be a sequence of unique scenarios not based on any GUNDAM storyline, and whatever money you have after winning the scenario carries over to the next scenario (leading to a cheat).

- Action Battle: Lets you practice battling up to 3 other ships or suits in the arcade battle mode that is used to resolve battles. Additions are a shield defense button for those suits that have one, a button to maintain the facing direction while moving (so you can fly backwards now), an I-Field on/off button for those suits that have it, and a jump/vernier thruster on/off button.

Ltd.","Digital Kids","1998-07-16","1","No","Action | Platform","Not Rated","Shake Kids is a game similar to Klonoa (or even similar to the classic Dynamite Dux arcade machine) released in 1998 in which you control one character that can be a boy named Randy or a girl called Nihni.

You must run, jump (though you can't jump at the very beginning), and fight your way through nine stages and fight four bosses along the way.

You can get hearts to increase your maximum vitality (five hearts gives you one big heart), glasses to see how much life the enemies have, and magnets. Getting three magnets will allow you to suck up any on-screen enemies regardless of whether or not they are dazed.

Mr. Shaker, a divine kind of shaking god or whatever, teaches you the way of the shake. By throwing your shaker at enemies, you can destroy them, but just throwing the shaker isn't enough to defeat all your enemies. When enemies are struck by the shaker, they momentarily get dizzy and during this time, you can initiate a jam session where you suck up any dazed foes in the area and you get your groove on. As the title suggests, you are kids that shake stuff up and you must hit the L and R buttons to shake your shaker in different directions.

STORY
One day, in a very strange place with buildings shaped like an octopus and ridiculously large ants and other animal-creature things, you meet two children...one being a boy and the other being a girl.

The boy, whose name is Randy (Randii) at default, is fourteen years old. The girl, whose name is Nihni (Niini), is twelve years old. Both children are curious and full of energy and the game allows you to choose one or the other (though there is really no difference between them). They are sometimes known as ""Shake Performers"" and they bring joy to the people by performing their crazy shake dancing rituals...or something.

Regardless, fast forward some unspecified amount of time and the world is in peril. Some fiend who goes by the name of Obaba (as well as Boss-J) has been going around the world and is the cause of the crazy bugs, wild animals, and other freaky disturbances. Your purpose is to go around using a weapon that resembles a cocktail shaker and doing what you do best...performing.

However, you can't do it alone. With the help of the 59 year old Goro N. and Mr. Shaker (who looks like a giant cocktail shaker jug), you will eventually have what it takes to set things right and your exploits will be documented in the ""Shake Times"" newspaper for the world to see."

Once a player matches up two tiles of the same type, they are removed and the pyramid is reduced. By removing tiles, previously restricted tiles may be opened up.

This anti-terrorist tank force was conceived after an ill-fated campaign at Mostvia Vatska in 1994. Coming under heavy fire, the troops sent a distress signal to the U.S. Intelligence requesting immediate backup. The government turned their backs on the Special Forces unit by making them expendable and refusing to send in backup. As a result, five men survived; those five men formed Da Wardenz.

Here's where you come into play. Assuming the role of a rookie commando, your mission is simple: prove yourself to Da Wardenz by destroying terrorist forces and rectifying global corruption. Easy, huh? That's not all -- you'll be in command of an M-13 Predator battle tank; this thing can mow down forests and calm any terrorist dispute. Along the way, you can upgrade your tank in armaments and shielding.

Shellshock is broken into two parts: The Pen and actual mission objectives. As Da Wardenz headquarters, The Pen has all sorts of locations including the main hangar, basketball court, simulation room, workshop area, briefing area, and various lockers.

Upon waking, the story begins in Tokyo as the Protagonist checks his email to learn that a mysterious man calling himself Stephen has sent out a suspicious 'Demon Summoning Program' to all those willing to use it.

This provokes much jealousy in Asuka, who also suspects that Kirishima is a spy who is trying to get information from Shinji about NERV and the Evas. Rei Ayanami is present but plays a rather background role in the story, though she seems to agree with the suspicions of Asuka. Gradually, a relationship between Mana and Shinji unfolds and they end up going on a date. It turns out, however, that Mana is one of three test pilots for the TRIDENT (alternatively named the ""Country Crawler"") units, a new competitor to the Evangelions, similar to Jet Alone; thus the name Girlfriend of Steel. Eventually, the TRIDENT goes berserk and the Evas have to destroy it.

The interactivity in most of the game is limited to walking around areas until the next plot event is triggered. However, the one true branch occurs at the end of the game, where the player may choose to focus on Mana, Asuka or Kaji. This choice determines which of the game's three endings are shown, with a fourth exclusive to the PS2.

In the Mana ending, Mana is discovered not to have been killed in the battle. Shinji rescues her and brings her back to his apartment. She showers, emerges wearing only a towel, and teasingly asks Shinji if he would like her to remove it (which she eventually does). In discussion with Misato, however, it is agreed that Mana has to leave Tokyo-3, and she says a teary goodbye to Shinji who has won her heart.

In the Asuka ending, Asuka helps Shinji to get over Mana and the two children grow closer as a result. This ending contains romantic images of Asuka and Shinji together, including a moving scene where Asuka hugs Shinji emotionally.

The third ending with Kaji does not focus on any one character as much as the other endings do. Mana is also discovered not to be killed, and says goodbye, with Shinji replying ""I'll be waiting for you""."

The series is based on illegal highway racing on the Shuto Expressway's Bayshore Route in Tokyo with custom tuned cars, a common occurrence at the time of the series' debut. However, since then Japanese police have begun cracking down on street racing and the hashiriya scene. Anti-street-racing legislation have also been enacted, levying heavier fines for street racing infractions. 

Despite this, the underground cultural phenomenon of illegal street racing has seen its popularity steadily growing in Japan since the mid-80's with its own dedicated manga (Shutoko Battle's biggest inspiration being Wangan Midnight), anime series and video games franchises (C1 Circuit, Wangan Trial, Naniwa Wangan Battle, etc.). Perhaps the most influential popular works spawned by the phenomenon were the six Shuto Kousoku Trial films (a.k.a. Freeway Speedway: Megalopolis Express Way Trial) released from 1986-1996, which were an obvious source of inspiration for the Shutoko Battle series. 

The game series' influence can be measured by the number of North American and European driving video games inspired by its iconic features, such as cosmetic tuning (Midnight Club, Need For Speed Underground, Juiced, and Supercar Street Challenge among many others), a wide selection of Japanese import cars, or the choice of Tokyo as the game setting, which has even influenced films like The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. Indeed, the trailer of the first the Fast and the Furious movie was included in western editions of Shutoko Battle Zero. 

The series is known under many names when published including the extra ""Drift King"" when released by BPS, it was renamed overseas Tokyo Highway Battle when published by Jaleco & THQ International. Other names include Tokyo Xtreme Racer by Crave Entertainment, Tokyo Highway Challenge and Import Tuner Challenge by Ubi Soft, and even Street Supremacy when released by Konami. 

The series was originally subtitled ""Drift King"", after the trademark nickname of street racing and professional racing driver Keiichi Tsuchiya who is featured in the first Shuto Kousoku Trial episodes and endorsed the game with, then team manager, Masaki Bandoh of Bandoh Racing Project. 

Shutokou Battle R is the third game in the series for the Playstation One console (after Shutokou Battle Drift King & Shutokou Battle Gaiden). The game features 3 game modes: 
- Scenario: Sort of a story mode, defeat the opponents to advance in the game. 
- Practice: Practice your driving. 
- Link Mode: Compete againts another player using the link cable.

The first installment in the Silent Hill series, the game was released in North America and Europe in February 1999 and in Japan in March 1999. Silent Hill uses a third-person view, with real-time rendering of 3D environments. To mitigate limitations of the console hardware, developers liberally used fog and darkness to muddle the graphics. Unlike earlier survival horror games that focused on protagonists with combat training, the player character of Silent Hill is an ""everyman""."
"Silent Hill","Silent Hill [NTSC-J]","Region Not Set","","Konami","Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo","1999-03-04","1","No","Adventure | Horror","M - Mature 17+","Silent Hill tells the story of a man searching for his lost daughter in a bleak tourist town. As Harry Mason and his daughter Cheryl were driving down the road, a dark, ominous figure appeared in the vehicle's headlights. Harry tried to avoid it; he swerved out of the way but lost control of the car and crashed.

After coming to, Harry stood up from the wreckage and took a look around. It was the spot of their vacation destination, only something was seriously wrong. There were no pedestrians or cars around; he was seemingly alone and his daughter was missing. It was snowing -- something seemingly impossible during the summer months and the air was filled with a thick, dense fog.

Much like the Resident Evil series, Silent Hill is played from a third-person perspective in a world emphasizing on elements of horror and fear. It focuses on realistic character controls -- Harry runs and acts like an average person; he'll get tired after constantly running around and begin to breathe heavily. Because most people lack the knowledge of operating firearms, Harry has an inaccurate aim meaning he often misses his target.

Unlike other survival horror games (circa 1999), Silent Hill takes place in a seemingly real town -- road signs and park benches are strewn about on each sidewalk and the buildings are modeled with names and window dressings. Instead of rummaging around through biochemical laboratories and big mansions, Harry will search for his daughter through an elementary school, a hospital and the town's many streets.

While walking down the various roadways, caution must be practiced -- horrific creatures are lurking about; hellhounds are ready to pounce on you, flying and seemingly skinned pterodactyls hover around, and little mummified babies with knives are prepared to end Harry's life. Fortunately, he has been supplied with a pocket radio that emits noise and static when an enemy is approaching -- will you run or will you face the unknown terror?

What started off as a vacation has turned into a nightmare...one that Harry may never wakeup from. Enjoy your stay in Silent Hill.

The U.S. based Entertainment Software Ratings Board gave the game a ""M"" rating for its graphic violence, blood and gore, and bits of profanity. The game was released for the personal computer in Europe, and the original PlayStation edition was given an international release.

As is the case with other graphic adventure games, progress in SilverLoad involves finding and interacting with various ""hot spots"" in order to pick up objects, solve puzzles and interact with (or kill) the various characters in the town. Picking up certain objects will cause the game's (and town's) clock to move forward, and thus, the trick to success is to pick up the right items in the precise order.

Two variations of play include the Street Tour Mode, where you skate through three 3D courses trying to pull off as many tricks as you can within a time limit, and Free Skate Mode, where you either play for points or practice your moves without worrying about the clock.

Skaters can also play against a friend in Versus Mode to see who can pull off the most tricks. Street Sk8ter features 200 different moves and combinations to perform while racing, each of which earns your skater points depending on its level of difficulty. Of course, if you wipe out, you'll have points deducted from your score. Three other ""traditional"" areas are available, including a Half-Pipe, Big Air and Bowl.

The main aspect of the game is the Street Tour, which is structured similar to a racing game: weave your way down sidewalks and streets, pass through checkpoints to extend your time, and finish before the clock winds down to zero. Along the way there will be plenty of opportunities to catch some air and perform tricks with the pad. The goal is to score as many points as possible with one of four alter-egos: TJ, Jerry, Ginger and Frankie.

Each skater also differs in style (Goofy or Regular) and has individual ratings in jump power, cornering, maximum speed and acceleration. Playing through the Street Tour with different characters allows you to open up additional routes, unlock bonus skaters and reveal new decks (designs on the main platform area of a board). You'll even get to increase your character's overall ratings!

After finishing each course, players will also be able to watch their performance on instant replay. Other notable features include: Dual Shock Controller support (vibration only), best times saved to memory card, an announcer, deck graphics from Powell Skateboards, and twelve alternative music tracks from bands under the Epitaph and Capitol Records labels."

Shogi means general's. 
 
 The earliest predecessor of the game, chaturanga, originated in India in the 6th century, and spread from China to Japan, where it spawned a number of variants. Shogi in its present form was played as early as the 16th century, while a direct ancestor without the ""drop rule"" was recorded from 1210 in a historical document Nichureki, which is an edited copy of Shochureki and Kaichureki from the late Heian period (ca 1120). 
 
 According to ChessVariants.com, ""Perhaps the enduring popularity of Shogi can be attributed to its 'drop rule'; it was the first chess variant wherein captured pieces could be returned to the board to be used as one's own. David Pritchard credits the drop rule to the practice of 16th century mercenaries who switched loyalties when captured - no doubt as an alternative to execution.""

Players are equipped with a small paddle, capable only of horizontal movement, which they maneuver so as to deflect a tiny ball around the screen -- the ball will destroy any brick it contacts, while continuing to ricochet.

Failing to keep the ball in play will result in the loss of a life -- lose three and the game is over. Destroying certain bricks will result in power-ups being dropped into play, which will alter such variables as the size of the paddle and the number of balls onscreen at any one time, to name but two. Power-ups can also be purchased between stages in order to better equip oneself for precarious situations that may lie ahead."

Mining facilities are established in different areas outside of Earth, particularly on large asteroids near the Moon and most especially on Mars. Various resources are found from these areas and distributed to Earth which aid in the world economy. The largest company that is established from this is the Jin-Sei (Exhausting Star) Corporation set in Japan which is worth 1 trillion in New Yen investments, founded by the Miama family.

However, after years of space resource distribution, the separate companies started initiating attacks that would dominate other company’s resources. The strongest of these attacks started on Martian colonies established by the second largest company on Earth, Eight Luck Interstellar Development Inc., which banded with smaller companies across Earth including ones in China, England, and America. Eight Luck planned on claiming Mars for its own so as to monopolize on the outsourcing of minerals as well as developing terraformed areas.

In response to these attacks, the Jin-Sei formed a union with the JSDF (known in the future as JDF) and began working on a space fighter program organized by Defensive Section 2 of the JDF known as the Scarlet Lotus Team (SOQ for short), which utilized a unique laser technology fighting system known as NALS (Non-blind spot All range Laser System) in combat. The threat of eco-terrorism was on the rise as out-spoken ecosystem protectionism groups opposed the company's outsourcing of materials; these were used as subsequent cover-up stories to hide the company war waging between Jin-Sei and Eight Luck from public awareness.

Made up of the best fighters adapted to this combat system as well as innumerable stamina strengthening tests for space travel, the SOQ are sent in to defend company territory from rival companies on Earth and space at all costs."

There are twists and turns throughout the game as you protect convoys from enemy attacks, engage galaxy class starships, and go on solo retrieve and rescue missions. The storyline is accented by the voices of actors Patrick Stewart (Captain Jean-Luc Picard) and Michael Dorn (Lieutenant Worf).

Your ship is outfitted with phaser cannons and photon torpedoes, both of which you will have to master in order to succeed in your battles with enemy crafts. Users can play from a view behind their ship or from a first-person view inside the cockpit. The game supports analog control as well as force feedback, and uses up one block of memory on the standard PlayStation Memory Card to save progress."

It became one of Capcom's early hits before Street Fighter II, revered for its innovative gameplay and multilingual voice clips during cutscenes (presented in Japanese, Mandarin, Russian, Spanish and English).

In the game, the player takes control of Strider Hiryu, a ninja-style warrior who must defeat a legendary being known as Grandmaster Meio. Meio has observed Earth from his dwelling in a far off galaxy, and has created a space station (known as ""The Third Moon""), between Earth and its original moon in order to rule earth and continue observation.

The year is 2048. Armed with a Cypher (a razor-sharp blade, wielded similarly to a tonfa which generates metal-cutting plasma) called Falchion, Hiryu must travel around the globe (including the Soviet Union and the Amazon Rainforest) to find and destroy the evil being. Throughout the course of the game, the player can obtain power-ups, including robotic animal-like companions (such as a hawk and a panther) which help him defeat enemies. He also has the ability to latch onto walls and ceilings using a metallic hook — an aspect which set the game apart from other platformers.

Additionally, Strider 2 makes use of the PlayStation's Dual Shock Analog Controller for controls and the vibration function.

Are you the ray of hope that will pierce the ominous darkness or will you join the rest of the Strider clan in oblivion? The world is counting on you."

The most notable change in Supercross is that EA opted to go with a more arcade-styled control scheme this time around. While this may come as a disappointment to gamers looking for the ultimate motocross sim, fact of the matter is, they tried the more realistic approach in the last game and it did not work well. Besides, with this game's new hold-the-accelerator-and-don't-let-go approach, gamers will get a better sense of the speed they would experience in they actually participated in a motocross event.

"Tales of Phantasia [Playstation the Best]","","NTSC-J","Japan","Namco","Wolf Team","2000-09-28","1","No","Role-Playing","Not Rated","Tales of Phantasia is a Super Nintendo game in the role-playing video game genre published by Namco and released in Japan in 1995, selling 212,000 copies. It is the first mothership title in the Tales RPG series and was later remade/re-released on the PlayStation, Game Boy Advance and PlayStation Portable. 

This game was originally developed by Wolf Team. It was written and programmed by Yoshiharu Gotanda, designed by Masaki Norimoto and scored by Motoi Sakuraba and Shinji Tamura. The character designs were created by manga artist Kosuke Fujishima. An anime series based on the game has also been created. 

STORY: 
Tales of Phantasia begins by showing a heroic battle between four unknown warriors against an evil sorcerer and king, Dhaos, the outcome of which changed the fate of the world. The warriors were victorious, but Dhaos escaped through time. However, four different heroes are awaiting him: they seal the weakened Dhaos away using the power of two pendants, thus returning peace to the world. 

Twelve years after Dhaos had been sealed away, a young swordsman named Cress Albane (Also romanized 'Cless Alvein') and his best friend, Chester Burklight, live in the town of Toltus. One day, while Cress and Chester are out hunting in the forest, the town is destroyed by a dark knight named Mars and his soldiers. Every villager is killed in the attack, including Chester’s sister and both of Cress’s parents. While Chester mourns, Cress vows for revenge. He decides he should flee to the town of Euclid, where his uncle lives; however, Chester refuses because he wants to stay behind and bury the dead first, and Cress finally decides to go by himself. 

Upon his arrival in Euclid, Cress heads to the northwestern house, where his uncle lives. However, on Cress's first night there, his uncle betrays him, and he is thrown in jail by Mars. The heirloom pendant entrusted to Cress by his father, Miguel, is taken away from him, but Cress does not know of its significance in holding Dhaos sealed, nor that his father was one of the four who sealed him away. 

In prison, Cress hears a voice, and the person it belongs to gives him a pair of earrings, which he uses to break down the wall of his cell. As he goes to thank the person, however, Cress sees that the individual has been impaled by a sword; he takes the blade and uses it to open the prison doors. In one of the cells, he meets a woman named Mint Adnade. She thanks Cress for freeing her and asks him to also free the person in the cell across from hers, who she says is her mother. At this point, Cress realizes that Mint's mother was the person who had helped him to escape his own cell. Not wanting Mint to learn of her death, he says that he saw no one in that cell and insists that they must escape immediately, which they achieve by traveling through the prison's aqueducts. 

GAMEPLAY: 
""Tales of Phantasia"" presents a unique combat system: The battles have a lot in common with fighting games: you fight on a platform that slowly scrolls forward and have to attack your enemy in real time. Other party members are controlled by AI. You can pause the game at any time and use magic, items, or choose an overall strategy for your allies. 

The playstation version is more a remix than a remake, since it features different character techniques, character voices, fmv sequences, new quests and enhanced graphics and music. 

  Manufacturer's description:

For young swordsman Cress Albane, it wasn't a typical day out hunting in the nearby woods. He had no hint of the tragedy unfolding back home.

Li Dian, Xiahou Dun, Xu Chu, Zhang Liao, Cao Ren, Xu Huang, the infamous Lu Bu as final boss. After defeating them all, there is also Cao Cao himself who would try to escape.

There is also a variety of weapons in the game which can be picked up.

You take the role of Cornet in the game. She's a young woman who lost her parents at a young age and possesses a strange ability to talk to and control puppets. With that rather unique mix, Cornet is a rather independent and strong-willed person despite her youth. Her quest intitially involves meeting the prince she first encountered in the forest, but it quickly develops into a much broader quest once her beloved prince is kidnapped under strange circumstances. 

Battling through the game will take Cornet to all corners of the kingdom. She'll make friends, face enemies and encounter betrayals throughout the course of her adventure. With multiple dungeons and many boss creatures, she'll have to build up a force of puppet friends to tackle this quest properly. She'll encounter potential puppet allies almost everywhere; graveyards, ancient ruins and even unwanted junk can make for some potentially valuable allies. Monsters you fight can join up with you as well, and they can either level up like your puppet allies or be sold to local monster collectors for some quick cash. 

Atlus has packed in a few treats for the devoted RPG enthusiast. Despite adding in English versions of all the songs from the Japanese original, those who enjoy Japanese voice acting will be able to set the language and hear the original songs complete with romanticized lyrics. 

As players progress through the game, event flags will open up new songs and images for you to look at from the title screen. Players will be able to play back their favorite songs while watching stills that tell the story behind the song. The image gallery shows extra sketches and moments from the game, although usually in a more detailed manner than the sprite-based graphics can depict. 

The American release of the game had these features: art gallery, sound test, and a bonus CD but instead of the bonus CD was a soundtrack CD with the game that features all the English versions of the songs along with most of the instrumental area music that plays during events and in the settings you explore. 

STORY: 
The game centers around the adventures of Cornet, a girl who can talk to puppets and has a magical horn that grants wishes, and Kururu, a puppet that has the heart and soul of a human. The majority of the game is about Cornet and Kururu trying to save Prince Ferdinand (whom Cornet is in love with) after he has been turned to stone by the self-proclaimed ""most beautiful witch in the world"".The witch, Marjoly, also has a crush on the prince and had meant to put him to sleep, but messed up the spell and accidentally turned him to stone. 

CHARACTERS: 
* Cornet Espoir: Cornet is the cheerful heroine of the game. She can sing, play the horn, and even talk to puppets; which most people cannot do. Cornet longs for a passionate relationship and despises toads. She longs for a prince to sweep her off of her feet. 

* Kururu: She is a puppet and Cornet's best friend. She follows Cornet throughout the game, often making humorous comments on her behavior. She likes cherries, and dislikes anything sour. Unlike other puppets, Kururu can move around on her own without the powers of Cornet's horn, and she can talk to other humans besides Cornet. She hides a deep secret, but for the better. her weapon of choice is a paper fan (she is only playable in the DS version). 

* Cherie: Cherie is Cornet's mother, whom is said to have been killed in an accident many years prior to the start of the game. 

* Ferdinand Marl E.: The prince, and soon to be king, of Marl Kingdom. He often sneaks out of the castle to hunt or visit the city. Cornet has dreamt of him her whole life and falls in love with him after a chance meeting in the forest. 

* Etoile Rosenqueen: She is Cornet's arrogant rival. Etoile often makes sarcastic remarks about Cornet. She is from a rich background and loves being the center of attention. 

* Marjoly: Marjoly is the sexy antagonist of the game, but is hardly the typical evil mastermind bent on world destruction. She lies about her age and often calls herself the most beautiful witch in the world.She's also one of the antagonists in the game Disgaea. 

* Gao: Gao is one of Marjoly's lackeys. It is said that she has the strength to fight a dragon with her bare hands. Many people mistake her for a man, including Cornet. 

* Crowdia: Crowdia is another of Marjoly's lackeys. She is very beautiful, but very narcissistic. She has large black wings, like a crow, and fights with a sword. 

* Myao: Myao is Marjoly's third lackey. She appears to be a child. She often acts childish and selfish, and she can cast powerful magic to summon dragons."

"The Airs","Airs","NTSC-J","Japan","Victor Interactive Software, Inc.","Victor Interactive Software, Inc.","1999-03-25","1","No","Role-Playing","Not Rated","On a world called Floatia, a land of continents floating in mid-air, a young man named Tigaro is about to be drawn into an adventure of a lifetime.

Developed by Pack in Soft, The AIRS has a wide variety to offer players. First and foremost are the Taplers. Taplers are flying machines used by the inhabitants of Floatia to move from continent. Taplers are also raced in the ""Celestial Cannonball"" once every decade, a race full of dangers, which claimed the life of Tigaro's father.

By selecting from over 70 seperate parts, players can upgrade their Tapler, which changes form, depending on the parts applied to it. This way, players can choose whether to build a sleek, fast Tapler which can run circles around the enemy, or a big, buff Tapler which can take a licking and keep on ticking. The choice is pretty much up to the player.

The world of Floatia is split into two seperate parts. First, there is the air, a completely 3D environment where the player can fly their Tapler, and interact with other Taplers. This interaction takes place in two primary forms; exchange of information and fighting. These aerial battles are also displayed in full 3D, making for some potentially spectacular battles. The second part of Floatia is the continents. Players can walk over the continents, on 2D maps, where they can enter towns and collect supplies and information.

Another rather interesting feature of The AIRS is the way the passage of time affects the game. During the day a character might reveal a particular piece of information, but at night the information he gives you could be completely different. There are also a few timed events in The AIRS.

To go from one air island to another one the player has to pilot the plane that is the only time in the game that used a third person perspective with a 3d engine, once he reached the new island he can go around and gather new information talking to the different characters that are around there."

Other gameplay elements include using bubbles to either protect sea-monkeys or imprison their enemies, collecting a certain number of goldfish to clear levels, and the requirement to rescue a specific number of sea-monkeys within pre-set time limits per level."

The Dodge technique from the previous two game is replaced by an ""emergency evasion"" or ""attack deflector"" technique, which allows the player's character to roll away or towards the opponent. In the latter case, the player can have the ability to roll towards the opponent and end up at the other side. The player can also determine the height of their jump and perform small or high jumps. Additionally, the graphics for all the character sprites from the previous games were redrawn and the commands for certain Special and Super moves were changed from previous games. Like in the previous, Super Special Moves can be performed when the Power Gauge is filled up or when the player's life gauge is flashing red. However, the player can also perform a more powerful version of their regular Super move if both conditions are met (the player has low energy and Maximum level power gauge)."

Advanced mode is based on the previous game in the series, KOF '96, but features a revamped Power Gauge. Instead of charging the Power Gauge, the Power Gauge is now filled whenever the player strikes the opponent or by performing Special Moves. The player can stock up to three Power Gauges. The player can use one stock of the Power Gauge to perform a Super Special Move or enter a ""MAX"" mode, in which the player's defensive and offensive strength are increased. Performing a Super Special Move while in MAX mode will make the player perform a more powerful Super Special Move.

Extra mode is based on the first two games in the series, KOF '94 and KOF '95. Like in those games, the player fills the Power Gauge by charging it or defending against the opponent's attacks. After the gauge is filled, the player enters MAX mode and like in Advanced, their character's offense and defense will increase. The player can only perform Super Special Moves in MAX mode or when the life gauge is near empty and flashing red. When the player performs a Super move in MAX mode while the life gauge is flashing red, then the Super move will be even more powerful. The Emergency Roll maneuver from KOF '96 used in Advanced mode is replaced by the side-step from KOF '94 and KOF '95."

Moe, Larry, and Curly are pressed into action when a cantankerous banker named I. Fleecem demands the mortgage be paid at Ma's Orphanage. She needs 5000 dollars in 30 days to save the business or else the children will be left homeless.

Each day represents one activity, which is selected by stopping Moe's hand as it moves across a series of colored spaces. If the hand lands on a mousetrap space, a finger is snapped and a day is lost. Four snapped fingers means the game is over. Other spaces include Banker, which means the Stooges spend the day losing ten percent of their cash or receiving a nasty comment; Money, which offers a random amount of cash; and Question Mark, which could result in either a windfall of money or a visit from I. Fleecem.

The majority of spaces are jobs in the form of mini-games. Curly tries to scoop up as many crackers as possible with a spoon, the Stooges race across a hospital in tiny racecars, Larry runs across a sidewalk to find a song before Curly loses a boxing match, and the trio, dressed as waiters, sling pies at their guests as quickly as possible. Completing each job brings the Stooges a step closer to their 5000 dollars goal, with surprises waiting for them if they manage to reach certain milestones. Progress during the adventure can be saved to memory card at the end of each day."

"Time Crisis (PlayStation the Best)","","NTSC-J","Japan","Namco","Namco","1998-09-03","1","No","Shooter","Not Rated","As Richard Miller, your primary objective is to eliminate all moving targets and save the girl; if you accept this mission, there will be lots of carnage and death following in your wake. 

Developed by Namco and previously released in the Arcade, Time Crisis is a first-person on-rails light gun shooter; there are two versions -- one with the Guncon peripheral and one without. Using either control method, you'll blast your way through three stages, each with four areas filled with hired goons and vile boss characters. When the action stage begins, you'll start from a crouched position while enemy troops try and thwart your objective. While they're reloading, stand up and start spraying the area. You will have the option of crouching behind objects at anytime during gunfights. Just remember to keep your gun reloaded! 

STORY: 
The main plot of the original Time Crisis arcade game release involves an attempted coup in the fictional republic of Sercia. For a millennium, the Garo family ruled Sercia with an iron fist. In 1995, the V.S.S.E. International Intelligence Agency sent William MacPherson, who successfully toppled the Garo regime and became its first democratically elected president. 

The last remaining member of the Garo family, Sherudo Garo, sought to recapture the throne from the hands of President MacPherson. He sends a mercenary named Wild Dog and kidnaps the president's daughter, Rachel. Garo demands military secrets in return for Rachel's safe return or he will kill her by sunset. V.S.S.E. sends its best agent, Richard Miller (also called the One-Man Army) to break in, invade Garo's castle and rescue Rachel. 

GAMEPLAY: 
Time Crisis is a three-dimensional first person rail shooter similar to Virtua Cop and The House of the Dead installments, in which the player holds a light gun and goes through the motions of firing at on-screen enemies. Time Crisis is best known for its cover system, in which players can duck behind cover to avoid enemy fire and reload his weapon. There are three stages, each consisting of three areas and a boss fight. 

There are various modes in which to choose including Arcade, Time Attack and the Special modes. Like the name implies, the Arcade mode is the original version of Time Crisis. Here, you'll follow the storyline and play until you've run out of lives, time or continues. Time Attack will have you blasting goons with unlimited lives. However, you must clear the stage as quickly as possible. In the Special mode, Richard Miller receives a new mission -- to infiltrate a weapons factory. Unique to the PlayStation, your success in this mode will determine the route the game will take. 

  Manufacturer's description:

TO DEFEAT A CASTLE FULL OF ARMED KILLERS, IT'S GOING TO TAKE WITS, SKILL AND COURAGE. AND ONE VERY BIG GUN. 

EVEN TIME IS YOUR ENEMY 
When Rachel, the President's daughter, is kidnapped by a madman, it's up to secret agent Richard Miller to save the day. The only thing standing between Richard and Rachel is an army of henchmen, a dozen or so murderous ninjas, and a few robotic assassins, just for good measure. The odds are tough, but with the Namco Guncon to even the score, Richard's got a fighting chance. 

Features the complete arcade hit, plus a new original scenario for the PlayStation game console. 
Hidden areas to discover throughout the game. 
Multiple endings, each linked to how well you complete your mission.

"Time Gal & Ninja Hayate","","Region Not Set","","Taito Corporation","Taito Corporation","1996-07-05","1","No","Action","Not Rated","Time Gal is a FMV-based game which uses pre-recorded animation rather than sprites to display the on-screen action. Gameplay is divided into levels, referred to as time periods. The game begins in 4001 AD with the theft of a time travel device. The thief, Luda, steals the device to take over the world by changing history. Reika Kirishima (霧島零香?), the protagonist also known as Time Gal, uses her own time travel device to pursue him; she travels to different time periods, such as 70,000,000 BC, 44 BC, 1588 AD, and 2010 AD, in search of Luda. Each time period is a scenario which presents a series of threats that must be avoided or confronted. Successfully navigating the sequences allows the player to progress to another period.

The player uses a joystick and button to input commands, though home versions use a game controller with a directional pad. As the game progresses, visual cues—highlighted portions of the background or foreground—will appear on the screen to help survive the dangers that occur throughout the stage; more difficult settings omit the visual cues. Depending on the location of the cue, the player will input one of four directions (up, down, left and right) or an attack (shoot the target with a laser gun). Inputting the correct command will either avoid or neutralize the threats and progress the game, while incorrect choices result in the character's death. Reika dying too many times results in a game over. Specific moments in the game involve Reika stopping time. During these moments, players are presented with a list of three options and have seven seconds to choose the one which will save the character."

Lara is armed with twin pistols with infinite ammunition, but she can pick up higher caliber weapons to take on deadlier human opponents. Lara also comes across restorative health packs and has a compass with which she can orient herself. Lara’s opponents include animals, gunmen, as well as primeval and supernatural beings.

It was first discovered by a tribe of ancient Polynesians who settled there and constructed a city in the meteorite crater. They worshipped the immense supernatural powers it appeared to hold, fashioning four artefacts out of the meteorite's core material (which become the focus of the game). Shortly thereafter, the tribe laid witness to the deformed birth of their prophesied leader, born without a face, and fled Antarctica in fear of what the meteorite was capable of. In the present day, the ancient Polynesian city has been buried beneath snow and ice and RX Tech are excavating the site, investigating the meteorite. Led by Dr. Willard, the crew discovers remnants of the Polynesian city, ancient stone statues resembling the Easter Island Moai, and finds the grave of a man named Paul Caulfield of the HMS Beagle.

When the game begins, Lara Croft is in India searching for a legendary stone in the ruins of an ancient temple once inhabited by the Infada tribe. She encounters Tony, an RX Tech employee who seems to be suffering from a severe bout of jungle fever. After parting ways, Tony remains one step ahead of Lara in their search for the stone, eventually finding it hidden deep within an underground cavern. After killing an oddly superhuman Tony, Lara takes the stone and exits. On her trek back to the Indian jungle, she is discovered by Dr. Willard."

Five thousand years later, Lara Croft discovers the lost tomb and unwittingly unleashes the Set, fulfilling the ancient prophecy of his return to plunge mankind into darkness! In a race against time, Lara must use all of her wit and skill to reimprison Set and save the world from Armageddon. Pursued at every turn by her arch-rival, the unscrupulous archaeologist Werner Von Croy, Lara embarks on a journey of discovery across Egypt, where she must overcome the most ingenious puzzles and infernal traps ever devised, and face terrifying evil from beyond the grave...

Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation plays very similar to the previous games in the series, but some new things have been added to the game. The biggest addition is that now rather large parts of the game consist of several interconnected levels sometimes explored in any order, with puzzles in one level often requiring that some actions are done in other levels. The new additions to Lara's arsenal are a revolver and a bow with several sets of arrows including exploding and poisonous ones. The players will also find a laser sight which can be attached to any of the two weapons described above allowing manual targeting and zooming. Inventory now holds a binocular with built-in flashlight and a handy crowbar (found later in the game). Lara has also learned a few new moves: she can climb into the niches with low ceiling if the crouch button is pressed, she can now move around the corners while hanging and she can also pull levers and open trap-doors while jumping. 

Graphics have been upgraded too - there are new light effects and water is now dripping from Lara's clothes when she gets on surface."

"Touge Max 2","","NTSC-J","Japan","Atlus Co., Ltd.","CAVE Co., Ltd.","1998-09-17","2","No","Racing","Not Rated","Toge or Touge is a Japanese word literally meaning ""pass."" It refers to a mountain pass or any of the narrow, winding roads that can be found in and around the mountains of Japan and other geographically similar areas, like the legendary Nordschleife in Germany.
 
 In order to decrease the incline of mountain roads, thereby making them easier for commercial trucks to pass, engineers place a series of S bends in steep roads that provide access to and from high mountain elevations. These passes have become popular with street racers and motorsport enthusiasts because they provide a challenging, albeit dangerous, course.
 
 Toge racing's notoriety outside of Japan may be attributed to entertainment media such as Initial D (originally manga, and later anime, and in 2005, live action under the Chinese title Tou Wen Zi D.
 
 Touge is a series of touge racing games published by Atlus in Japan since 1995. The series was originally developed by Cave, however Touge R was developed by Nextech. As best sellers, Touge Max: Saisoku Drift Master and Touge Max 2 received re-releases in Sony's The Best line of budget range games. The gameplay focuses on import sports cars driving downhill in Japanese mountain passes using the drifting technique on curves.
 
 The first Touge Max game was the only game released outside Japan, and Touge Max 2 is the first game released only in Japan.
 
 Game Modes:
 - King Battle: Battle against the king of each of the 4 courses and there are 3 difficulty levels and different cars to choose.
 - School: practice the tracks and learn the drift basics
 - Time Trial: Race againts time
 - 2 Players: Compete compete against another human player
 - Story: Compete against computer controller players in a story mode in which the player is a young driver that wants to become the drift king and the player will go through different jobs, situations and vehicles to drive."

"Turnabout","","Region Not Set","","Natsume","Artdink","2003-05-01","","No","Puzzle","E - Everyone","While the old adage that ""turnabout is fair play"" applies in many situations, Natsume's Turnabout is all about diabolical puzzles where players rotate the entire puzzle while the pieces move within its borders, sliding and rolling into mind-numbing configurations and patterns. The 100 puzzles provided are divided into two groups of 50: Begin Mode and Main Mode. The first 50 puzzles must be solved in order to open up the remaining 50, but the puzzles are numbered in five rows of ten each -- solving seven rounds in a row will open up the next row of ten, thus the puzzles needn't be solved sequentially.

Puzzle pieces in Turnabout come in three types: colored balls, colored blocks, and sliding blocks. By rotating the puzzle board, balls and sliding blocks adhere to the forces of gravity and fall down into open slots. Manipulating the puzzle correctly takes skill and usually no more than ten to fifteen ""steps,"" even at advanced levels. Learning to solve puzzles backward by picturing the flow of the pieces mentally can be an essential tool to success and none of the 100 puzzle board configurations are the same shape. For players looking for even more challenges, up to 50 custom-made puzzles can be devised, using five different colored balls and blocks and nine movable sliders (blocks) in Edit Mode."

It combines elements from various end of the world scenarios, both secular and religious, with its own mythos. The story takes place at the end of days, in the year 1999. The series follows Kamui Shiro, a young esper who returns home to Tokyo after a six-year absence to face his destiny as the one who will determine humanity's fate. The series is intended for a female audience, so X is drawn in the ornate style characteristic of shojo manga but with the emphasis on moral conflict and gruesome violence expected of seinen works. The story is influenced by the works of Go Nagai and Kyokutei Bakin. 

The events take place in 1999. The end of the world is fast approaching as superhuman individuals gather and take sides in the city of Tokyo, the battle site of Armageddon. The key player in this day of reckoning is Kamui Shiro, a young man who returns home to Tokyo after a six-year absence to protect those dearest to him, Kotori and Fuma Monou, and fulfill his mother's dying wish. 

Unbeknownst to the three friends, Kamui and Fuma are destined to fight each other during the end of the world. The first half of the series focuses on the gathering of the soldiers in the final battle and culminates with Kotori's death at the hands of her brother Fuma, sealing Kamui's choice as the protector of mankind and Fuma's place as his foil. The second half follows Kamui as he grows into his role as savior while the world moves along toward its inevitable destruction. 

The story is Kamui's heroic journey, where the narrative places an emphasis on his choices and how they affect the world around him as he attempts to reconcile his dual destinies.

Recording the stories of five to deploy a multi-format omnibus, 3D sound more powerful. Fear and to experience a variety of three high school girls full of personality. The whole story has finally become clear!

Twilight Syndrome - Kyumei Hen is a direct sequel to the first Twilight Syndrome game, continuing the spooky adventures of the three brave and reckless high-school girls: Yukari, Mika, and Chisato. The first mystery involves a girl named Sakura Himegami, who was killed in an accident many years ago; apparently, her ghost is still around somewhere. The trail leads to an abandoned path in the mountains; Mika decides to venture there, while the other two are going back to school at night, hoping to find more clues.

The gameplay is identical to that of the previous entry: the player navigates the digitized images of the girls over 2D backgrounds in a side-scrolling/third-person perspective manner, searching for clues, triggering scenes, and choosing responses and/or actions when prompted by the narrative. As in the first game, these choices may influence the course of the story, and lead to various endings of the chapters; reaching a ""bad"" ending prevents the player from continuing to the next chapter."

The gameplay here is very minimalistic: the player can navigate the 3D models of the heroes (several characters can be controlled at once, as a group) through the limited areas (also rendered in 3D), searching for clues and escaping from danger. There is no other interaction, no usable items, and no combat.  The story of Twilight Syndrome: Saikai focuses on four Japanese teenagers: Yuri, her sister Masa, and their friends Atsushi and Aya. It all begins when the youngsters hear rumors about spirits contained in the school building. At night, Yuri and her friends go into the school and play a spirit-summoning game."

Well, maybe not every; but in Japan, this seems to be a rather popular theme. Mysterious disappearances, ghostly photographs, untimely deaths, eerie sounds coming out of the music room - all these things attract the curiosity of three high-school girls: Yukari, Mika, and Chisato. At night, armed with nothing but a flashlight, the trio of heroines enters the dark school building, prepared to explore every corner, and investigate every urban legend they have heard of...

Tansaku-hen opens the Twilight Syndrome horror adventure series, defining its stylistic traits and gameplay. The game is divided into chapters, each dedicated to a particular ""ghostly"" story. Unlike most Japanese-style adventures, there is physical character navigation in the game; the player moves digitized images of the three girls on 2D backgrounds, in a manner somewhat similar to side-scrolling games - though many areas feature a third dimension, like in Western third-person perspective adventures.

The gameplay consists of two activities only: walking and occasionally choosing a dialogue option and/or action, as prompted by the game's narrative. There is no other kind of interaction, no inventory, and no combat. Different choices may lead to different endings; the next chapter can be accessed only if the player has not attained the ""bad"" ending."

Every year, a mysterious man named Calypso sends e-mails to renowned drivers, inviting them to compete in a tournament called Twisted Metal. The conditions of the tournament are anything but ordinary: opponents fight each other in armored vehicles with mounted weapons. The winner receives an audience with Calypso, and is granted a single wish - a wish without limits, be it money, power, or even our reality itself. In 2005, the annual tournament is held again in Los Angeles, and twelve drivers, each with his own agenda, have come to compete to death.

Twisted Metal is a vehicular combat game. The player selects one of the twelve available drivers and takes part in the competition. In the one-player story mode, the player must progress through six combat stages; all the opponents must be destroyed in order to win the race. In the two-player co-op mode, players choose a battlefield and control two cars in an attempt to get rid of the competition.

All the vehicles are equipped with two mounted machine guns; though relatively weak, they have unlimited ammunition. Other weapons can be picked up by driving over them during the races. These include fire and homing missiles, land mines, tire spikes, and others. Each participant has a life bar, which can be replenished by entering a specific area on the stage."

"Wing Over 2","","Region Not Set","","Pack-In-Video Co., Ltd","Victor Interactive Software, Inc.","1998-09-23","1","No","Action | Flight Simulator","E - Everyone","Wing Over is the name given to a secret competition held each year between the world's most highly trained pilots. The game originated during the Gulf War when many pilots confirmed they suffered from stress and nervous energy during the periods they were not operational. These pilots discussed ways to overcome their problem and devised a set of rules for a world competition that would relieve their stress.

The solution was an international athletic pageant, a simulated air battle under strict rules and guidelines. Teams consisting of four members of both mechanics and pilots travel through eight different countries each year, to fight air battles and compete for an overall total score.

Wing Over puts you in the cockpit of these teams, for head-to-head dog-fighting action against some of the world's most sophisticated fighter planes including the Spitfire MK1, Mirage III, Focker DR1, F/A-18A Hornet, Saab Draken and A10 Thunder Bolt. Four different types of gameplay will challenge the most educated flight sim addicted, from the arcade style ""Free Game Mode"" to the in-depth perils of ""Versus Mode"".

Battle against each team in breathtaking backgrounds and landscapes with locations from the United States to the freezing Antarctic.

Offering much more than quick fire flight sims, Wing Over demands strict game player disciplines where teamwork and careful planning are the order. Individual heroics will no longer be enough for victory, players must take into consideration the safety of their crew members, budgeting their winnings for fighter upgrades and clever tactics to survive in this Brave New World.

Both flying lessons and missions take place in random conditions. Relying on the aircraft apparatus is essential in thick fog while at night all around is blackened out apart from a row of landing lights. Other environments include bright sunshine, dawn, cloudy days and a most impressive stormy condition where lightening streaks across the sky and momentarily flashes over the ground.

There are several viewing angles which are rear, chase, target, fly by and cockpit... probably the most sensible when learning. After each lesson or mission a replay is available which may be fast forwarded by using the shoulder buttons.

Wing Over 2 is two games in one. First there is the Recipro Course and then the Jet Course. I suggest playing in that order as the Jet planes are much more difficult to control.

The Staff Room is used to browse through your training record as progression is made.

The Student Office is the place to go first for a temporary job. The credits earned for performing these tasks is used to pay for your training. Simple tasks involve delivering a food parcel to Fisherman's Park in a light plane for 1000 Credits. Medial employment includes taking a bunch of tourists on an island flight for 2000 Credits. Tasks eventually move towards sinking a fleet of war ships while under enemy attack from the air for a huge 5000 Credits. The sixteen jobs gradually open up as you progress through the flying lessons.

Next, visit the receptionist to pay your tuition fee before moving on to the Briefing Room for a description of the upcoming session. Lessons are divided into 4 stages with 4 sections to each stage. At the end of each group of lessons you will be tested on what you have learned and then rated accordingly.

FEATURES:
* Full 360' freedom of movement
* Dual Shock & analog flight stick compatible
* unique virtual cockpit
* over 20 state-of-the-art aircraft
* challenging ground & air based missions
* intelligent foes /increased AI

  Manufacturer's description:

Introducing a new gaming experience Wing Over 2 puts you right in the pilot seat as you're taught the finer points of air combat. With enough flying hours under your belt and having passed the five training levels plus graduation exam, you'll be qualified to fly the game's 26 different aircraft in any on of the twenty special missions.

Start by learning the basics; a loop here, a dive there and head onto more complicated air-to-air combat manoeveurs by way of a series of flying school exams.

The more exams you pass, the greater your hanger access will be, opening up a whole airbase of top-end fighters and jets for you to use.

The problem with air combat school, though, is that it costs money and you're gonna have to earn your filthy lucre by flying errands for the academy

Your school isn't going to let you loose in an F16 to escort the Presidential jet through enemy territory; well not until you've lost that 'rookie' status anyway!

Third or First person perspectives.

Players control futuristic anti-gravity ships owned by racing corporations and pilot them on eight circuits. Each craft is equipped with an energy shield that absorbs damage sustained on the track; if the shield is disabled, the player's craft can be knocked out of the race. Shields are regenerated in a pit lane that is set apart from the main course. The less time spent in the pit lane, the less the shield will regenerate.

In addition to shields, each racing craft contains air brakes for navigating tight corners, as well as a ""hyper-boost"" option. Players can activate the hyper-boost to increase their speed, but the boost drains energy from the shields, making the craft more vulnerable. Using special speed pads on the course allows players to increase their speed without resorting to the boost."

Crusaders of the Dark Savant is the seventh installment of the Wizardry series and a direct sequel to Bane of the Cosmic Forge. In the end of the previous game, the party of heroes finally acquired the Cosmic Forge. However, before they were able to decide what to do with it, it was taken away by a servant of the Cosmic Lords, the cyborg Aletheides. It appears that the Cosmic Forge was in fact a clue to the location of the Astral Dominae, the artifact of life, somewhere on the planet Guardia, which has now been revealed to the universe.

The heroes then travel to Guardia, which is populated by many races and organizations with their own agendas, including the rhinoceros-like Imperial Umpani Federation and the spidery T'Rang affiliated with a malevolent being known as the Dark Savant, whose goal is to get rid of the Cosmic Lords. All these factions are looking for the Astral Dominae, finding which is the primary goal of the game. Depending on the decisions made by the player in the previous game (should he opt to import the party from there), the game will have different openings and begin in different locations. However, regardless of the initial premise, the player is free to follow or betray whatever faction he was supposed to be allied with.

The gameplay system is very similar to that of its predecessor, retaining the races, the classes, the skills and the magic system it introduced to the series. The trademark first-person exploration and turn-based combat are present as well. Unlike the previous games, Crusaders of the Dark Savant allows the player to explore towns and vast forest areas between them, in addition to several large dungeons situated in different areas of the game world. Many NPCs have their own agendas and may move between locations as well, and even obtain crucial items themselves if the player-controlled party is not quick enough, forcing the player to change plans. The exotic setting contains elements of science fiction on top of the traditional fantasy background. Like in the previous game, encounters, events, as well as the heroes' reflections upon them are described through text messages.

A few skills have been added, including swimming and climbing, as well as diplomacy. The latter reflects the more important role dialogues and interaction with NPCs play in the game compared to the previous installments of the series. A mapping skill has been added, which, if learned, displays - for the first time in the computer releases of Wizardry games - an automap on top of the exploration screen. Skills are increased with repeated usage and the characters now receive separate bonus points for each category (weapon, physical, and academia). Like before, magic is divided into four schools (Psionics, Alchemy, Theology, and Thaumaturgy) and six elemental categories."

It contained three games from which a player may choose:

    Midnight Wanderers: Quest for the Chariot (known in Japan as Roosters: Chariot no Sagashite (ルースターズ ～チャリオットを探して～)) - A platform game that sees the player control a hobbit named Lou and his travelling companion, Siva, to run, climb, and shoot at enemies.
   
 Chariot: Adventure through the Sky (known in Japan as Chariot: Tenkuu he no Tabi (チャリオット ～天空への旅～)) - A shoot 'em up game featuring the characters from Midnight Wanderers, but in a Gradius-esque game.
    
Don't Pull (ドンプル) - A puzzle game similar to games like the Eggerland series, Pengo and Capcom's own puzzle game Pirate Ship Higemaru that involves you controlling either a rabbit named Don (Player 1) or a squirrel called Pull (Player 2), pushing blocks to crush monsters.

Three Wonders was ported in 1998 to the Sega Saturn and PlayStation.

Capcom rereleased this collection of games in 2006 onto Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2 on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox and Capcom Classics Collection Remixed on the PSP.

The main character of the Chariot and Midnight Wanderers games Lou, was used as an assist only character for Marvel vs. Capcom he also had the option character from Midnight Wanderers known as Firestorm with him. His sprite is like an enlarged version of his sprites from Midnight Wanderers, he shares the same position stance, his trademark jump in which he holds his hand on his hat, and also the same shooting animation. The sprites are recoloured in a more vibrant cartoon-esque style, as opposed to the washed out effect from the games, to match the style of the Marvel vs Capcom series. If two players get Lou, then the second player's pallette is Green, and is most likely based on Siva's color clothing from the Midnight Wanderers game. Player two's firestorm is colored orange.

Lou's Companion Siva, has a character based on him as a tribute, featuring on Capcom's Cannon Spike game. The character is called Shiba Shintaro."

Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.

Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends."

The worms can walk and jump around and use tools such as the ninja rope and parachute to move to otherwise unreachable locations. The worms have an arsenal of dozens of weapons, ranging from longbows to bazookas and from fireball to Holy Hand Grenades. There are also an array of special weapons, such as Armageddon (meteor shower) or the end-all, be-all Concrete Donkey. Some of these weapons are present in the worms' initial arsenal while others can be collected from randomly appearing crates during the game. For some weapons, such as grenades, holding the launching key longer shoots them further. The landscape can be deformed with any weapon, forcing the players to adapt to changing environments. Also, in addition to the nature-made obstacles, the maps may contain land mines which explode when a worm comes close to one, and barrels which explode when shot, spreading out some burning napalm. These often lead to fancy combinations where, for example, a worm is first hit with a grenade and is then thrown against a mine which sets off another worm, which hits a third worm who slips into the water."

"Wu-Tang: Taste the Pain","Wu-Tang: Shaolin Style","PAL","United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland","Activision","Paradox Development","1999-11-12","4","No","Fighting","AO - Adult Only 18+","Wu-Tang Shaolin Style - aka Wu-Tang Taste the Pain in PAL regions - is a four-player, 3D fighting game for the PlayStation. The basis for the game's story and setting is the real-life rap group the Wu-Tang Clan, featuring characters based on their stage personas and the martial arts themes of their music. Some members of the group also provided voiceover work for the game and made vocal and production contributions to the game's music.

Wu-Tang: Shaolin Style uses the same engine created by its developer, Paradox Development, for their unreleased PlayStation title Thrill Kill. That game was noteworthy for allowing up to four players to fight simultaneously, a feature heavily utilized in Wu-Tang: Shaolin Style.

Battle an evil warlord named Mong Zhu as members of the rap group Wu-Tang Clan in this 3D fighting game featuring nine playable characters. Master the martial arts as RZA, Method Man, Raekwon, GZA, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Masta Killa, U-God, Inspectah Deck and Ghostface Killa. The Story Mode starts you off in a courtyard area called the Hub, which resembles a city intersection with four separate alleys. Each alley leads to a fight against specific enemies from the Mong Zhu clan.

Overcome challenges by successfully demonstrating Shaolin skills, and learn different fighting styles in your quest to become a Wu-Tang master. Completing each task will earn you one of 36 possible ""chambers,"" which will gradually unlock secrets. Reveal 50 fatality sequences, hidden characters, new arenas, concept art, and other special features. In addition to the Story Mode, the game includes a Versus Mode supporting up to four human- or computer-controlled characters at the same time.

The 36 Chambers:
Throughout the course of the game's Story Mode the player advances through a series of challenge, called the 36 Chambers - a reference to both the real life rap group's debut album and also a classic kung fu film, both of the same name. These challenges range from visiting certain locations to performing combos of a certain length. Rewards for completing these include character concept art, new game modes, characters, and fatalities. Given that some of the chambers requires pulling off a certain fatality, the player may be forced to complete a certain goal before proceeding to the next one. Also, the player cannot face the last opponent (and therefore complete Story Mode) until they have first gained 35 chambers - the 36th being awarded for defeating Mong Zhu himself.

Versus Mode offers a choice of arenas, characters, and handicap options. There are also two types of games. ""Original"" gives each character a specific number of lives, with the winner being the last one standing. ""Advanced"" introduces a kill limit to the free-for-all, with the first person (or team) to reach the limit declared the winner. Wu-Tang Clan: Shaolin Style also features a practice option to help you learn each character's special moves. Three exclusive songs from the group were created specifically for the game and are included in the soundtrack."

It is Capcom's third fighting game to feature Marvel Comics characters and the first game to match them against their own, with characters from Marvel's X-Men franchise being matched against the cast from the Street Fighter series.

It was the first game to blend a tag team style of combat with the Street Fighter gameplay, as well as incorporating elements from Capcom's previous Marvel-themed fighting games, X-Men: Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes. It was ported to the Sega Saturn in 1997 and PlayStation in 1998. However, the tag team feature was omitted from the PlayStation version due to memory limitations."

"Zanac X Zanac","Zanac Neo","Region Not Set","","Compile","Compile","2001-11-29","2","Yes","Shooter","Not Rated","The Celebration of a Classic Compile'd in a New Way.

In 2001 veteran ""shmup"" and puzzle game developer Compile, released Zanac X Zanac to the Japanesse market for play on the Sony Playstation. It came out on the 15th anniversary of the original Zanac.

Zanac X Zanac consists of two separate games; the original Zanac(in various iterations) and the debut of Zanac Neo. It can best be described as part classic compilation, part updated re-imagining of the original.

Zanac
Zanac is a top down, 2D, vertical scrolling, space shooter. Gameplay consists of frantic scrambles between dodging bullets, shooting down enemies, and powering-up your spacecraft. The original Zanac game released in Japan in 1986 for the MSX home computer and the Family Computer Disk System(Famicom Disk System). Zanac proved to be one of Compile's more popular titles thanks to it's eventual US release on the Nintendo Entertainment System that same year.

There are two things that may stand-out to Zanac players; it's frantic pace, and it's ever-changing playfield. Rarely are two games of Zanac identical. This is due to the games innovative use of the company coined ""A.I."" system. The game was programmed in a manner that gives a slightly different experience with each play. Things such as enemy type, enemy speed, and enemy placement are adjusted in real-time based on the players skill level, number of lives, and power-up configuration(similar to ""rank"" systems found in shooters such as Battle Garegga many years later). Many shooters at the time relied on pattern memorization. Zanac demands a player to be ever mindful of the dynamic play-field.

Weapon Power-Ups

At the start of a game, or a new life, the player may feel terribly under-powered. However, Zanac has a robust power-up system that allows your spacecraft to become very powerful. A rapid and constant cycle between the player feeling under-powered one second then awesomely overpowered the next is typical throughout a game of Zanac. The player starts with a standard rapid-fire shot(pea shooter), and a ""0"" level sub-weapon.

The sub-weapon can be changed or upgraded several times depending on the players tastes/gameplay situation. This is done through collecting floating power-ups during gameplay which are numbered ranging from ""0"" to ""7"". Each number represents a different type of sub-weapon with a unique form of attack. By collecting different numbers, the player will switch sub-weapons. By collecting the same number the players current sub-weapon is upgraded to become more powerful, up to 3 times.

The players standard rapid-fire shot can also be upgraded by collecting a different type of power-up in the form of yellow ""orbs"". The orbs are only found within blue blocks that scroll down from the top of the screen. The blocks must be shot apart to reveal the possible orb within. Some blocks do not house orbs, and instead treat the player to a scatter-shot of deadly bullets. Other than powering-up the standard rapid-fire shot, another key component of the orbs are that when they're collected they provide momentary invulnerability. This is a key strategic maneuver if you plan to last through the difficult levels of Zanac.

Included versions of Zanac

Zanac X Zanac contains two classic iterations of the the original Zanac as well as two exclusive modes:

- ""Disk Version""(Family Computer Disk System version)

- ""Rom Version""(Nintendo Entertainment System version)

- ""Special Version""(enhanced graphics/sound, exclusive mode)

- ""Score Trial""(single level score attack, exclusive mode, also in Neo)

Each version includes a ""save"" and ""load"" feature. This allows for recoding of high-scores and the ability to continue from the level previously reached. Continues are unlimited however, your score will reset upon ""Game Over"". These features are also included in Zanac Neo.

Zanac Neo
Zanac Neo is a top down, 2D, vertically scrolling space shooter. The game shares nearly the same gameplay as the original Zanac. The signature ""0"" - ""7"" numbered power-up system makes a return, as well as the yellow orbs that augment your standard shot and provide momentary invulnerability. The graphics, music, and sound effects have all been updated. More detailed and interesting backgrounds were added to the levels, and music from the original game returns in remix form.

One of the major additions to ""Neo"" is being able to select from 3 different ships upon starting the game. Each ship has slightly different movement/shooting properties and each have slightly different sub-weapon implementation. In the spirit of the original game, there are still 8 different sub-weapons that can be picked-up and upgraded during play, allowing for a variety of unique weapon combinations for each ship.

Another addition comes in the form of a new type of ""power-shot"". As enemies are destroyed a bar fills at the bottom of the screen allowing for the player to unleash a powerful beam shot. When the bar is completely filled a bomb can also be fired that can clear enemies and/or set-off a chain reaction of orb-block explosions.

Zanac Neo supports two player simultaneous play, a first in Zanac history."

As part of the Official PlayStation Magazine, Vol. 41, the playable Crash Bash demo and Spyro: Year of the Dragon demo can make it easy to switch between PS1 games without having to get up out of a comfortable chair to change the demo disc in the PlayStation gaming system. Each demo version includes three levels of the official PS1 game. The bright orange label helps to keep track of the game disc so that a search does not have to occur by getting misplaced underneath a book, magazine, or paperwork after the disc is removed from the PS1. Crash Bash is a PlayStation game filled with battles, tournaments, and arena adventures. It is a struggle of good versus bad between two witch doctors. Aku Aku is the protector of all things good while Uka Uka is his evil brother. The characters of choice are Crash Bandicoot, Coco, Tiny, Dingodile, Dr. Neo Cortex, Dr. N. Brio, Koala Kong, and Rilla Roo. Crash Bandicoot’s speed, intelligence, and agility gives him the ability to conquer challenges quickly and efficiently. His sister, Coco, has inherited the same skill set and keeps close to her polar bear friend. Dingodile has a crocodile tail that is powerful enough to strike down opponents. Tiny is a tiger with a throwing force that saves the day. Dr. Neo Cortex sees the world as his own at all costs and uses his laser cannon tank to prove it. His partner, Dr. N. Brio, is unstoppable with his laser and his skill in long tank shots. Rilla Roo keeps to his own pace and attacks with unexpected force with his tail. Koala Kong was created by Dr. Neo Cortex, complete with kicking and throwing power that does not fail to hide his strength. In Spyro: Year of the Dragon, Spyro and his allies must find all the dragon eggs that the evil sorceress has stolen and hidden across multiple forgotten worlds. There are mini quests to complete, special skills to learn for challenges, and speedways for racing. Posts of accomplishments are recorded in the Atlas to help keep track of what has been completed and what remains. Even posts to keep count of gems earned can be found in the Atlas. As expected with an official PlayStation game, variety is a factor in the fun as game playing includes controlling Spyro and his allies from other worlds. Sheila the Kangaroo hops, jumps, kicks, and stomps to stay alive. Sergeant Byrd is a penguin that flies with air missiles on his shoulders. Bentley the Yeti carries a big club and uses it with success when necessary. Agent 9 is a lab monkey turned special operative with skills in laser blasters and explosives. You can play this Official PlayStation Magazine demo sampler of Crash Bash and Spyro: Year of the Dragon and share the experience with the PlayStation video game community through online posts or a favorite magazine. You can check for posts with follow up questions to send a message with any gaming results that need to be shared. You can send a message to friends who find enjoyment each time they receive a demo game disc that comes with the Official PlayStation Magazine. PlayStation demo discs can give a glimpse into what video game fun lies ahead. You can mix up a collection of PlayStation video games by adding the Crash Bash demo and Spyro: Year of the Dragon demo disc."

The show's premise was that aliens had been living among humans for ages, and were the origins of many of the creatures humans know from myth, folklore and legends, including vampires and werewolves.

On the show, the Roswell UFO Incident which is part of a conspiracy theory (that many real life people still hold to this day) is portrayed as being a man made phenomenon. It was set up by humans to deflect popular attention from the truth. The unidentified flying object was a prop; the body of a little green or grey man was a dummy; the witnesses to the crash were plants; as were the Air Force investigators. In fact the whole shadow world surrounding Area 51 was nothing but a distraction from the fact that the aliens had landed long ago and there were known incidents of their desire to attack, assimilate and/or destroy the human race."

"Roswell Conspiracies: Aliens, Myths & Legends","","Region Not Set","","Ubisoft Entertainment","Red Lemon Studios","2001-06-14","","No","","T - Teen","Roswell Conspiracies: Aliens, Myths and Legends was an animated program, that originally aired in 1999 as part of BKN, the syndicated's cartoon programing block. The programming segment premiered in 1992. The show was part of BKN's drive to reinvent itself. The show's premise was that aliens had been living among humans for ages, and were the origins of many of the creatures humans know from myth, folklore and legends, including vampires and werewolves.

On the show, the Roswell UFO Incident which is part of a conspiracy theory (that many real life people still hold to this day) is portrayed as being a man made phenomenon. It was set up by humans to deflect popular attention from the truth. The unidentified flying object was a prop; the body of a little green or grey man was a dummy; the witnesses to the crash were plants; as were the Air Force investigators. In fact the whole shadow world surrounding Area 51 was nothing but a distraction from the fact that the aliens had landed long ago and there were known incidents of their desire to attack, assimilate and/or destroy the human race."
