Snowland, who lost the princess who controls the magic of snow, begins to melt little by little. At this rate, the kingdom will soon disappear! Nick and Tom, the snowmen, felt unprecedented resentment at being robbed of the princesses in front of them. They vowed to rescue the princesses from the hands of the villains, and set out for the kingdom of Hotda, where the enemy was waiting.

The home of the enemy, Hotda Castle, is a 70-store stone tower. A fire-breathing monster is roaming, and Atchich is worried about the fire and built the castle out of stone. It's more like a fortress than a castle because it's durable first, so it's not a very elegant castle. The snowmen, who are not good at hot places, tried to infiltrate the hot castle of Atchich with courage."

"10-Yard Fight","10ヤードファイト","NTSC","United States of America","Nintendo","Irem Corp.","1985-10-18","2","No","Sports","E - Everyone","The game is viewed in a top-down perspective and is vertical scrolling. The player does not select plays for either offense or defense. On offense, the player simply receives the ball upon the snap and either attempt to run with the quarterback, toss the ball to one of two running backs, or throw the ball to the one long distance receiver - basically the option offense. On defense, the player chooses one of two players to control, and the computer manipulates the others. The ball can also be punted or a field goal can be attempted."
"10-Yard Fight [5 Screw]","","NTSC","United States of America","Nintendo of America, Inc.","Irem Corp.","1985-10-01","1","No","Sports","Not Rated","The main idea of this game is that players take control of a football team and have the task of trying to score a touchdown before the clock runs out.

Players start out as a high school team. Games consist of two halves. One touchdown must be scored before time runs out in each half or the game is lost. After a touchdown is scored, the half ends and the 2nd half of the game starts. If the player scores in both halves, they win the game and then move on to the next level of difficulty. Difficulty levels after high school go from college, pro, then to super. The higher the difficulty, the less amount of time is given for a player to score a touchdown.

Since the game is concerned with scoring touchdowns, in the 1 player game the player is always on offense. Players can score points for completing passes and for gaining yards by either rushing or passing. Scoring a touchdown also adds to the player's score, as does any remaining time on the clock after the touchdown is scored. Also after a touchdown, the player can add on to their score by kicking an extra point.

Other rules on the field include getting a 1st down to add time to the clock. If the player throws an interception or goes four downs without getting a 1st down, they are penalized yards.

In a 2 player game, the second player plays defense until it's their turn to play offense."

Składanka była dodawana najczęściej do kompletu z konsolą MT-777DX a z czasem można było ją dostać w sklepach elektronicznych a także na bazarach. Był to solidny kartridż którego obudowa była gruba i twarda, zaś płytka PCB zapełniona po brzegi układami scalonymi. Producenci widać starali się by kartridż był wykonany w wysokiej jakości i przyciągał ludzi do kupna konsol oferując na jednej kasecie dużą ilość gier w cenie jednej; w niektórych rejonach zapewne kaseta reklamowała Pegsusa tak jak Tekken reklamował PSXa. Obudowa na początku była w przyjaznym dla oka kolorze fioletowym, później pojawiały się reedycje kartridża, różniących się kolorem i kształtem obudowy a z czasem także pojawiła się podróbka ''168 in 1'' do której dodano parę innych gier. Na labelu były miniaturki okładek wybranych gier, które między innymi znajdowały się na karcie. Nad obrazkami widniał napis ''168 in 1'' a obok napis ''high quality'' o czym wspomniałem wcześniej, producenci kartridża zapewniali nas o wysokiej jakości już na labelu a także go reklamowali grą Contra, która była pożądana w tamtych czasach i była najbardziej popularną grą zaraz obok Super Mario Bros (napis Contra widniał na labelu a także po uruchomieniu konsoli ze 168 in 1 witało nas duże logo CONTRA z Bóg wie czemu przygrywającą muzyczką z gry Booby Kids, niemniej bardzo ona pasowała i nie drażniła uszu). Kartridż miał także label z tyłu obudowy, na którym widniał mikroskopijnym drukiem cały spis gier jakie zawierała składanka; później takie labele pojawiały się na innych składankach, które zawierały kilkadziesiąt gier i więcej, był to niewątpliwie wielki plus dla graczy gdyż mogli sprawdzić jakie gry zawierają składanki bez kupowania ich w ciemno."

Size-optimized ports of Artemio's 240p Test Suite to 8-bit consoles

I've remade Artemio Urbina's 240p Test Suite for three more platforms:

    Nintendo Entertainment System
    Game Boy and Game Boy Color (as ""144p Test Suite"")
    Game Boy Advance (as ""160p Test Suite"")

The NES and GB ports are in assembly language for speed and size efficiency. The GBA port is in C, but still size-optimized to fit well within the 256 KiB multiboot limit.

The GB and GBA ports have a different name because their LCD video timing doesn't match that of NTSC. They exist to test not only the TV but also the Super Game Boy or Game Boy Player accessory, which behaves as a scaler.

Some functionality has been rearranged to fit the controller or to combine the function of similar tests. Some help pages have been rewritten for completeness, conciseness, and English usage improvements. Some tests' graphics have been replaced to keep the software free.

To get set up to build the NES port, install GNU Make, Coreutils, Python 3, Pillow, and cc65 per nrom-template instructions. The port to Game Boy uses RGBDS instead of cc65. The GBA port uses devkitARM and libgba by devkitPro, but Python 3 and Pillow are still required to convert the proportional font.

Like Artemio's original versions, these ports of 240p Test Suite are free software under the GNU General Public License, version 2 or later.

Compete against a friend, or play witchoself (get those tissues, though)! There are 3 different 2-player games, along with a bonus 2-player game that you can unlock after beating all the games as 1-player. If you look around, you might also find ANOTHER 2-player only game that is hidden within! The entire reason I started programming this game was to try and kind of vindicate myself in some way. I had already done some other games that were bigger in scope than the games of Tic-Tac XO, Pegs and !CLIK!, but didn't like how I had coded them due to being newer using 6502 at the time. All you have to do is look at the sources for those games to understand what I'm talking about! So, I went about putting the basic elements of those games into one cart, but just more standard (for instance, just regular Tic-Tac-Toe), and for 1 or 2 players. With that said, there is some sort of glitching that happens to the PPU during Tic-Tac-Toe that I could never track down, but ah well. It was a neat project. Snail Trail, one of the bonus games, was an idea for a parody of the Tron cycles game. Originally I was going to have the snails move UUUUU-BER slow. I think it turned out better having them move at the speed they are, though."

"3D Block","","Region Not Set","","","Hwang Shinwei","1989-01-01","1","No","Puzzle","Not Rated","3D Block is a pirated port of Blockout, made for the Famicom by Hwang Shinwei in 1989. There are three versions: a 1989 version credited to Hwang Shinwei and a 1990 version credited to ""RCM Group"" with a slightly different title screen. A 1991 version exists on some multicarts and credits both.

This is an adaptation of Blockout, which in itself is a 3D version of Tetris. This is emphasized with the cartridge itself, having the artwork ripped from the original game. In this version the well is 5x5x10 cubes large and the size never changes, unlike the official versions. The controls are somewhat unorthodox, as unlike most other games, the Select button pauses the game while Start speeds up the block so that it moves to the bottom of the well faster. The block designs themselves are the same as in the arcade version of Blockout.

There are 20 levels in total, with the player being able to start on any of the first 9, and the speed of the game can be set like in Tetris. Normally, you can select only the first 10 levels, but by pressing A, B, Up, then Down on Controller 1, then pressing A to increase the level number counter, you can select levels 11-20 as well. The levels increase in speed as they progress and on most of the levels there are blocks which are in full 3D as opposed to standard Tetris blocks. On each level, 4 layers have to be cleared to advance. Clearing all of the blocks on the screen automatically ends the level. After completing level 20, the game reverts back to the title screen where the shape in the middle changes color to reveal a nude, poorly digitized woman wearing high heels. This same effect can be found by pressing A, B, Up, then Down on Controller 1, then pressing Select 10 times on the title screen.

The graphics are mostly taken from Blockout, apart from the title screen and menu, which are original. When the blocks are stacked up in this version, they appear to be layers of squares. The music, however, is the same music heard in Hwang Shinwei's other games."

7 GRAND DAD is a Mario-themed bootleg of the 1991 NES game The Flintstones: The Rescue of Dino and Hoppy. It was most likely created by the Taiwanese bootleg publisher J.Y. Company[2] in 1992.

There are very few differences between the two games. The most notable difference is the title screen, which is completely changed. The only parts that remain from the original title screen are the blue background, the salmon font color of the game title, a flashing white text saying ""PUSH START BUTTON !"", and a picture of Fred Flintstone in a gold star (which was originally a part of the Hanna Barbera Super Stars logo). The title screen music, a remix of ""Meet the Flintstones"", stays the same as well. The rest is completely changed. The title and logo are replaced with a large salmon ""7"", a picture of a bootleg Mario recolor (later nicknamed Grand Dad) with the character's head overlaid by the Fred Flintstone star, and a salmon ""GRAND DAD"" in a curious square-ish font. The credits at the bottom of the screen are replaced with white text saying ""1992 1"". The ""1"", commonly mistaken to be a bootlegger's nickname, is in fact a level select which can be used by pressing the ""Select"" button, which causes the number to go up (until 5).[3][4] This level select was implemented by the bootleggers and wasn't featured in the original game.

During gameplay, the head of Fred Flintstone's sprite is replaced with the head of Super Mario from Super Mario Bros. 3. However, during cutscenes and the basketball minigame, Fred appears unedited, and he is always called by his real name. Finally, the ending credits are altered to say, ""PRESENTED BY XXXXX"" instead of ""PRESENTED BY TAITO"". The rest of the final credits are unchanged.

The game was originally distributed in its own bootleg cart, under the title 原始瑪莉[note 1] VII (GRAND DAD 3M). Later, it was included in a Russian Mario 7-in-1 Dendy multicart, as 7. MARIO 7."

These strange jewels of power were formed at the eyes, or centers, of the eight nuclear explosions which nearly destroyed the Earth.

The task of retrieving the 8 Eyes falls to you, Orin the Falconer, the bravest and mightiest of the King's Guardsmen.

Developer Nice Code Software ported the game to the NES because the original Atari Flashback console utilized an ""NES-on-a-Chip"" architecture. 

Air-Sea Battle is basically a target shooting game. On most settings, you are positioned at the bottom of the screen and you shoot at targets at the top of the screen. The various settings provide different targets and weapons with different characteristics.
 
In games 1-6, you are an anti-aircraft gun and you shoot, unsurprisingly, at aircraft. You are stationary. Your control is limited to selecting the time of firing, the angle at which your shot is fired and, on some settings, exertion of minor control over the direction of your missile.
 
In games 7-12, you are a submarine and you shoot torpedoes at the ships above. On these settings you are able to move your submarine back and forth across the bottom of the screen. Your torpedoes, however, can only be fired directly above. Some settings allow minor control over the direction of your torpedo once fired. In games 13-15, you are apparently the anti-aircraft gun again. This time, however, you are shooting at shooting gallery targets (clown faces, ducks, rabbits). The controls are as in games 1-6.
 
 In games 16-18, you are a ship and you fire polaris missiles at jets flying above. Your ship constantly moves on its own, you control only the speed. When you fire, the angle of the missile and its speed are based on the speed your ship was traveling at the time of firing. Some settings restrict your ability to change speed once a missile is fired, others allow you to exert control over the missile by changing speed once the missile is fired.
 
In games 19-21, the situation is reversed, you are the jet dropping bombs at the ships below. The controls in this setting are the same as in games 16-18. The difference, of course, is that you are dropping bombs from above at targets below.
 
In Games 22-27, one player is the jet and the other is the ship.
 
 Each of the two player games is a matter of who can hit more targets in (oddly enough) 2 minutes and 16 seconds. (The manual says that the game will also end if one player hits 99 targets. I have yet to see this happen.) I"

Japanese release of Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse. Besides just the different title, Akumajō Densetsu, the Japanese version has several other differences. Most notably, the original Japanese version contained a specialized ""VRC6"" coprocessor chip. Other changes differed in the gameplay or graphics. Instead of using a stabbing dagger, Grant throws daggers as his main attack. Some enemies do less damage in the Japanese version, and had their sprites changed for the Western releases. Some instances of nudity on the enemies were also censored, and religious iconography was pared down. The Japanese version had slightly different backgrounds in many stages, and had special effects not seen in the North American and European releases.

The year is 1476, and Count Dracula has started to ravage Europe with an army of monsters. The Belmont family of vampire hunters, once exiled from Wallachia, are called into action by the Church. They feared the Belmonts' ""super-human"" power, but with Dracula menacing to swallow Europe in darkness, they are left with no choice but to call Trevor Belmont, current wielder of the Vampire Killer Whip.

Joining Trevor Belmont in his mission to defeat Dracula are three new playable characters: Sypha Belnades, a young sorceress with poor physical attack power but powerful elemental magic spells at her disposal; Grant Danasty, a pirate with the ability to climb on walls and change direction in mid-jump (a rare ability in earlier games of the series); and Alucard, Dracula's son, a dhampir with the ability to shoot fireballs and transform into a bat. Trevor can be accompanied by only one companion at a time. If he chooses to take on another he must abandon his current companion. The player can ""spiritually transform"" between Trevor and his ally with the ""select"" button. Both Trevor and whoever is accompanying him share the same health meter. The ending of the game differs depending on which companion Trevor has with him at the time, or if he does not take another character with him at all. The ending determines the path of the character to Valhalla."

The game, set in New York City, is considered a spin-off from the Pachio-kun franchise. Al Capone has a cameo role in this game even though he lived about one thousand miles to the west (Chicago) in real life.
Roads, taxis and automobiles are not portrayed in the game. However, a black limousine that escorts the player from the air force base to the final casino is portrayed as driving on grass. This is in direct opposition to the real New York City where the majority of the surface is concrete (either as roads, parking lots, or as foundations for the buildings). Only parks and some older residential districts use grass in their design in the real world. Buildings are either shown as dilapidated tenements, shiny towers, or as flashy casinos.
An English language translation was made in 2007 by a ROM hacker who goes by the nickname of ""Pale Dim."" Using the game's upper case letters that resemble the Joystix font, the English translation allows players in English-speaking countries to better understand the game. One of the changes made was to change the explosion sound from the Japanese Bom to the English Boom."

The players takes control of a space-fighter equipped with a front laser gun and ground bombs. Although the game features power-ups, they follow an unusual and unique formula - tiles on the ground must be destroyed in order to upgrade the main weapon or trigger special events. 

However, three of these tiles must be destroyed to activate such power-ups - B creates a temporary barrier around the ship,P upgrades the primary weapon and L gives the player an extra bonus at the end of each stage. Another interesting twist to the game is the Uoru armor; a shadow sometimes appear on the ground and if the player aligns his own shadow with it, then the ship transforms into a powerful robot for a short amount of time. Each stage ends with the same boss battle; a large Mega Argus fortress with a slow flashing core at its center, and the only way to destroy this pernicious mothership is to bomb its core when it is fully exposed. After the boss is taken care of, the player must successfully land on a runway and be cautious not to crash the ship. Argus features nine levels and includes a two-player alternating option."

The player is unaffected by attacks from airborne units while they are playing on the ground level, but the ship is automatically brought back into the air after a certain period of time. The player can still be hit by attacks from ground units while they are on the ground level, and can also lose their ship by crashing into obstacles. The 8-way joystick controls the player's movements, and one button is used for shooting, and the other is used for descending to the ground (or un-equipping wings). The background image continues infinitely when the player scrolls in the horizontal directions.

Completing the final level of the game causes the score counter to increase to 9,999,999 points, which the player can enter as their high score. The player can also score cheap points by equipping and un-equipping their power-up. Pressing the button twice while the un-equipping animation is occurring cause the player to gain 2,000 points. The player gains an extra life every 40,000 points, so it is possible to gain lives almost infinitely. If the player gains over 10,000,000 points in this way before completing the final level, the counter takes over 20 minutes to increase to 99,999,999 points."

Imitation of the Four Heavenly Kings Star"") is a Nintendo Family Computer life simulation video game that portrays the life of either a musician or a famous performer of the monomane (模倣?, ""imitation"") style of Japanese theatre. The object is to earn popularity while performing concert tours through the fictional city. Celebrity challenges are included in the game; they are considered to be miniature games like swimming and kicking a giant ball into a goal in a manner similar to soccer. While these games are fun to play, losing results in a loss of popularity points similar to performing terribly at a concert.

Appeasing senior citizens by performing gigs at the nursing home is another way to gain popularity. Otherwise, they will criticize the player's music or theatre styles without an end. After gaining the respect of the elderly, the mad faces eventually turn into frowns (and eventually smiles). Television appearances come in the form of talent shows, televised concerts, and several other surprises. The eventual goal is to convert all stadiums and concert venues to the player's colors. In addition to popularity meters for the players, music styles have their own popularity meters. Smiles with the player's colors determine which music styles are best liked by the player's fans. This determine what music or theatre styles to play and which ones to avoid in certain concert venues.

In the talent contest, the show is like a tournament where four people compete in a semi-final format. After the judges give their score, the two players with the lowest score are eliminated. The players with the highest score end up competing in a final round where the highest scoring player is the winner and receives popularity points. During the actual performance, the player must choose his or her musical style(s) and must improvise the lyrics. During a televised concert, the game proceeds like in a normal concert. The only difference is that an increased number of popularity points are rewarded for a successful concert.

When the player draws a certain combination on the dice, he or she must go to a nursing home and impress a grandmother with his or her musical or theatre styles. If the player can impress the grandmother with his or her music, then the player is accepted more by the elderly people. However, the elderly people can get grumpy again if the player manages to make the grandmother angry each time that the player has to perform at the nursing home again. All the text in the game is in Japanese. Other combinations of the letter and number dice can create or ruin a player's popularity along with other side effects.

The dice combination ""A-1"" is the best combination and it causes a rapid rise in popularity, which means more fans show up to the lucky person's concerts. Getting an ""F-5"" is the worst combination and will result in a loss of popularity. However, all other combinations can have either negative, neutral, or positive results for the player. Guessing about the result of the dice throw is all the fun of trying to get popularity for the band and greater appreciation from different age groups."

Each side is represented by a craft called a ""rotofoil"", which can be controlled by either a human player or a computer-controlled ""droid"" with ten levels of difficulty. (The game allows for human vs. human, human vs. droid, and droid vs. droid matches.) The basic objective of the game is to score points by either firing or carrying a floating ball into the opponent's goal. The game takes place on a flat, checkerboard playfield, and each player's half of the screen is presented in a first-person perspective.

A player can gain possession of the ball by simply running into it, at which point it is held in a force field in front of the craft. The opponent can attempt to knock the ball away from the player using the fire button, and the player in possession of the ball can also fire the ball toward the goal. When a player does not have possession of the ball, his or her rotofoil automatically turns at 90-degree intervals to face the ball, while possessing the ball turns the player toward the opponent's goal. The goalposts move from side to side at each end of the playfield, and as goals are scored, the goal becomes narrower.

Pushing the ball through the goal scores one point, firing the ball through the posts from close range scores two points, and successfully scoring from long range (where the goalposts are not visible) scores three points. The maximum number of total points between the two players is ten, meaning that any points scored that would take the combined total above ten will cause the opponent's score to be reduced by the same amount, resulting in a kind of tug of war scoring system. The game ends when either a player successfully scores ten points or the timer runs out. If time runs out and the score is tied, the game goes into ""sudden death"", where the first player to score wins."

Bases Loaded featured a unique television-style depiction of the pitcher-batter matchup, as well as strong play control and a relatively high degree of realism, which made it one of the most popular baseball games of the early NES.
One unique feature of the game is that the pitcher can provoke a batter to charge the mound. Each team has only one batter (usually the team's best hitter) who can be provoked in this manner, however; it is up to the player to discover who it is.
At the time Bases Loaded was released, few video games were licensed by major league sports. Therefore, the league depicted in Bases Loaded is a fictitious league of twelve teams"

While the Famicom version has a grand total of 99 levels; there is no ending screen implemented in the game.

In the Famicom version of the game, players have to unite two penguins, Gurin (male) and Malon (female), who are in love. The MSX version features a human boy and a human girl; gameplay remains identical to the Famicom version. Players control Malon and Gurin simultaneously; with a timer adding to the difficulty. These penguins move in mirror images of each other. The game features many different stages. After completing the 17th stage, players have to start over again on stage 1. ""Je te veux"" by Erik Satie is the background music in the game during the levels. Upon uniting the two penguins, Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"" is played.

A top-down view is utilized in the game; similar to the method used in The Adventures of Lolo. Standing in their way are spiders, birds and other creatures which the player must attack with the penguins' spray. Cobwebs occupy some of the cells on the playing field; possibly slowing the player down long enough for a spider to kill either Gurin or Malon. With each level arranged on a 10-by-15 grid and a vertical wall separating the two penguins from each other, only the upper central cell is free for both characters to reach. This ""free cell"" always holds the caged heart that is required to complete the level. A row of walls surrounding each player in a maze-like environment.

In the hack, all overworld and underworld maps have been revamped, so no maps from the original game will be encountered. The areas in this hack may need to be completed in a different order than the original game.

It is recommended to complete the original game before attempting this hack. Once the new layout has been familiarized with, the difficulty level and completion time of this hack is comparable to those of the original game. This hack, however, tests in-depth knowledge typically only obtainable from having played the original game. Items are generously distributed, because the hack is intended to be challenging but fun.

Three different routes all lead to the ending of this hack. The more upgrades obtained, the easier the route, but the longer the route as well. The question of whether the Lost Key can be recovered, remains. Everything discovered can be used to an advantage, so it is recommended to take notes of any clues encountered."

The prosperous planet Altile (aka 'Altair') has remained at peace for centuries, but in 2036 AD, a mysterious and extra-dimensional entity invaded the peaceful world and turned it into a barren wasteland. The player takes control of Naito (aka 'Night', 'Z-type Earth Defence' or 'ZED'), an android sent to stop the invasion and keep aliens from taking over the planet. Naito must explore eight large areas on Altile, all subdivided into several zones called 'Periods'. Each period only requires the player to find a key and an exit door in order to successfully complete it. However, they are conveniently hidden from view and this is where the weapon system comes into play. The robot is equipped with bombs and a blaster gun - although the latter is rather limited and mainly used to take down enemies, the powerful bombs explode after a short period of time and are designed to clear parts of the playfield (such as bushes or pillars), thus revealing hidden items (such as the key). But, of course, there is a catch and Night instantly receives extensive damage if he gets caught within a bomb's blast radius. Bombs also come in limited quantities and the player needs to constantly refill his bomb bag by either killing enemies or by revealing special icons hidden within the playfield. Additionally, the android comes with a limited amount of batteries - each battery provides a small amount of energy which gradually, and inexorably, depletes. Thankfully, Naito can use or store a myriad of items - Standard items (such as Bombs, Extra Energy, Score Items or Keys) are instantly activated, whereas Select Items (such as Energy Tanks, Missiles, Super Speed, Candles/Lamps, Super Bombs) must be manually activated in the inventory screen (available by pressing select). Although the goal of each Period is to locate a key and the exit door, some levels feature different challenges, item shops, treasure rooms and a multitude of other secrets."

"Bonk's Adventure","","NTSC-U","","NEC Home Electronics, Ltd.","Atlus | 																Red Company","1994-01-01","1","No","Platform","Not Rated","The game's protagonist is Bonk, a strong caveboy who battles anthropomorphic dinosaurs and other prehistoric themed enemies.  Bonk's mission is to rescue Princess Za (a small pink Pleisiosaur-type reptile) who has been kidnapped by the evil King Drool (a large, green Tyrannosaurus-type dinosaur).  In the Arcade version, Bonk is also assisted by a female version of himself.  Bonk attacks enemies by ""bonking"" them with his large, invincible forehead.  Bonk starts the game with three hearts' worth of health, which are depleted to blue as Bonk takes damage and three extra lives.  Bonk's health can be restored in increments by collecting fruits and vegetables.  Bonk can also collect pieces of meat as power-ups; these lend him special abilities and make him stronger.  There are three stages of power-up: his normal self, a second stage during which he can stun enemies by pounding on the ground and a third stage where he becomes temporarily invulnerable.  Meat can be found in two varieties: big meat and small meat.  The effects of meat are additive but wear off over time.  A small meat gives Bonk the second stage of meat power but will eventually decay into the first stage of meat power, and then back into regular Bonk.  Eating a small meat while in stage two will put Bonk into the third, invincible stage of meat power.  And eating either size of meat while in the third stage of meat power-up will reset the timer on Bonk's meat power.  Bonk can occasionally collect red heart power-ups that refill an entire heart worth of health, or even more rarely, a large red heart which restores all of Bonk's missing health.  There are also two rare, blue heart power-ups in the game which will increase Bonk's maximum health by one heart.  Bonking an enemy will typically knock it backward and slightly into the air.  Defeating an enemy yields points and also releases a small ""smiley"" power-up.  Bonk's smileys are totaled at the end of each stage after defeating the boss of that stage.  The player is given additional points and a caveman type congratulation based on how many smileys were collected."

Also known as Crush Roller. Which the name came from.) made by Hwang Shinwei in 1990. This game can often be found on multicarts and was sold in Brazil as a stand-alone cart by CCE.

The player starts with 9 lives in this version, as opposed to the 3 that there were in Make Trax. The scoring system in this game works differently, in that no points are awarded for painting over the road and that running over a fish awards one point more than the points the player currently has on the current level. (e.g. if the player has 7 points when they run over a fish they will get 8 points for doing so) There is a 200 second timer in this version which the original game did not have. The graphics are mostly the same, although the title screen is completely different and the enemies that leave footprints look different in this game. The music is reused from Magic Jewelry.

This game was later hacked by NTDEC to make Bookyman, which was released on the Caltron 6-in-1 and the Asder 20-in-1. It replaces the title screen, some of the graphics and the sound. Strangely, while the Caltron version replaces the music and most of the sound effects, the Asder version does not despite having been released a year later. Likely for Space in the Cartridge.

"Cabal","","NTSC-U","","Milton Bradley Co.","Zippo Games","1989-01-01","2","Yes","Shooter","E - Everyone","The player assumes the role of an unnamed commando trying to destroy several enemy military bases. The player's character is seen from behind and initially starts behind a protective wall (the wall can get damaged and shattered by enemy fire). The player must use a limitless ammunition gun and a limited number of grenades to fend off enemy troops and damage the base. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen depletes as foes are destroyed and certain structures (usually the ones that collapse when destroyed, rather than simply shattering) are brought down. At the successful completion of a level by fully depleting the enemy gauge, all the remaining buildings onscreen collapse and the player progresses to the next stage. Boss fights, however, start from the beginning if a player dies. (A feature criticised by many players. It can be circumvented, however, if two players play simultaneously and at least one stays alive at a given moment.)
Power-ups appear from time to time, being released from objects destroyed onscreen. Some power-ups give special weapons: One of them is an extremely fast machinegun and other one is an automatic shotgun with a slightly lower firing rate, but has a larger crosshair, allowing it to strike a wider area with each shot. Others grant extra grenades or additional points.
Two players could play this game, cooperatively, simultaneously.
The arcade cabinet is a standard upright. Each player uses a trackball to move the player from side to side, and move the crosshairs about the screen. On later board revisions, a joystick was installed instead with an optional sub-pcb for use with a trackball. With a trackball, rolling (an invincible movement during which the player could not attack) is done by pushing the trackball to maximum speed."

Well think again, 'cause according to a damsel in distress, evil Count Dracula has left a horrifying curse in his wake. And the only hope you have of ending the terror is to destroy his missing body parts!

Led by the immortal Count Dracula, the greatest army of evil ever assembled is poised to bury mankind in a Tomb of Terror. Destroying this legion of Swamp Dragons, Slasher Skeletons and Forces of the Undead will be the supreme challenge for the mightiest of warriors.

Your place in history is 100 years before Simon Belmont's birth. Dracula is young at heart, and it will take more than a stake to penetrate his evil. Luckily, you command the role of Trevor - Simon's forefather and the origin of the Belmont Warlord Chromosomes. 

Trevor has a power never before seen by human eyes - the power to transform into three different spirits: Grant DaNasty, the ferocious Ghost Pirate. Sypha, the Mystic Warlord. And Alucard, Dracula's forgotten son. You must perfectly time Trevor's body transformations to match up his different fighting spirits against Ultimate Evils. Trevor also has the strength and wisdom to command the Battle Axe, Invisibility Potion and Mystic Whip. 

But the most important weapon Trevor has is your cunning to choose the correct Paths of Fate and your bravery to lead him past 17 possible levels of never-ending doom, including the Haunted Ship of Fools, the Sunken City of Poltergeists, the Clock Tower of Untimely Death and Curse Castle.

Each screen is played against a time limit, marked by a Mighta pushing a boulder along the top of the screen. The Mighta reappears in Bubble Bobble as a recurring enemy.

Chack'n's aim is to reach the top of the screen before the time limit expires. He is delayed in this process by a series of solid walls. In order to get past the walls, he must free hearts from cages using his hand grenades.

A further obstruction comes in the form of Monstas (same creatures to appear in Bubble Bobble) hatching from eggs. Hand grenades can also be used to destroy the creatures or the eggs producing them (however, the player will get bonus points after completing the level for not destroying any enemies).

Clarice is constantly under pursuit by police cars, which she can take out by launching oil cans at them, temporarily stunning them, and then ramming into them with her car. Jaleco was inspired by maze chase action titles like Pac-Man (1980) and Crush Roller (1981) while designing the game.

City Connection was ported to several platforms, including the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). In Japan, the game has maintained a loyal following, with the NES version being seen as a classic for the platform. It has since been re-released through several Jaleco game collections and services such as the Wii Virtual Console. These versions attracted more mixed responses in North America, with critics disliking its simplicity, lack of replay value, and poor controls. Some felt it possessed a cute aesthetic and unique concept, and was entertaining to play. Jaleco produced a sequel named City Connection Rocket for Japanese mobile phones in 2004. The game is credited for having one of the first female protagonists in a console game."

To prove that she has visited a particular location, she must drive around the location painting every section of the road white. However, the police, who have no tolerance for vandalism, attempt to stop the driver from completing her goal. The player's car can jump and fire cans of oil. To avoid forcing the player from retracing the same roads again, the roads change color when the car drives over them, indicating that that specific road has been painted. There are three main obstacles: police, cats and spikes. The police chase after the car and if a police car comes into contact with the main character's car, the car ""explodes"" by turning into a group of hearts and the player loses a life. To combat this, the player can obtain cans of oil, which can be used to cause the police cars to spin out of control, allowing the player to bump them off the screen. Other enemies include a cat, which, when hit, causes the player to lose an extra life as the cat goes diagonally off the screen (but does not cause the car to ""explode"") with playing of a comical music, ""Der Flohwalzer"", known as ""Neko Funjatta"" (I Stepped on the Cat) in Japan. There is also spikes, which make the car ""explode"" on contact. Occasionally, a balloon may float by during any given stage. If the car touches one of these balloons, it collects it and collecting three such balloons will activate a warp that sends the car multiple stages ahead and provides significant bonus points. Although the city you travel to will change, the difficulty pattern of the road will remain the same. As the number of cities you travel to loop endlessly, the game is not shortened by taking a warp. One particular thing about this game is the ""catchy"" tune that plays in the background as you enter a new city.

There were typically 1 - 3 enemies on screen at once, appearing out of a trapdoor in the top corners, or let in through the side walls. Every few levels there was also a boss, ranging from a small dragon to a centipede. The bosses changed colour from Green to Blue to Pink, each time increasing in speed. Each level also contained a hidden letter which made up a password presented at the end of the game (Zone 4 Level 11).

Inviting two of the other elite high schools to participate in the challenge, plus an additional team sponsored by his wealthy father, Todd has seemingly stacked the deck against Crash and his boys. The game has four different teams to choose from, as well as a fifth computer-controlled team. Each team have five members each with their own strengths and weaknesses, making some better suited to certain events than others. Before each event, players have the opportunity to go shopping in the mall to buy power-ups for their characters. These items are paid for through the various medals that each team achieve as they progress through the challenge, but since the winner of the challenge is the team that collects the most medals overall, players must be fairly judicious in how much they spend. There are two types of events in the game: individual events (Hammer Throw and Roof Top Jumping) and head-to-head events (400 Meter Hurdles, Swimming and Fighting). In individual events, each team takes turn individually and ranking is determined by who gets the most points. The head-to-head events take place under a single elimination tournament format, in which one player against another in a series of heats. The player who successfully defeats both of his opponents will get to compete against a member of Team Thornley for first place. The game can be played by up to four players. Since there's never more than two teams competing at the same time, the third and fourth player can play simply by alternating between the two controllers.

    Windows that open and close (the most common danger).
    Bald-headed residents (a.k.a. Mad Doctors), who throw objects such as flower pots, buckets of water and fruit in an effort to knock the climber off the building (with larger objects appearing by more aggressive Mad Doctors in later levels).
    A giant condor, who drops eggs and excrement aimed at the climber (two at a time in the early stages, four in later levels).
    A giant ape (styled like King Kong), whose punch can prove deadly (he becomes more aggressive in later levels).
    Falling steel girders and iron dumbbells (more numerous in the later levels).
    Live wires, which protrude off electric signs.
    Falling 'Crazy Climber' signs.

Some of these dangers appear at every level of the game; others make appearances only in later stages. Should the climber succumb to any one of these dangers, a new climber takes his place at the exact point where he fell; the last major danger is eliminated.

One ally the climber has is a pink ""Lucky Balloon""; if he is able to grab it, the climber is transported up 8 stories to a window. The window onto which it drops the climber may be about to close. If the window that the climber is dropped onto is fully closed, the balloon pauses there until the window opens up again. The player does not actually earn bonus points for catching the balloon, but he is awarded the normal 'step value' for each of the eight floors that he passes while holding the balloon.

If the climber is able to ascend to the top of a skyscraper and grabs the runner of a waiting helicopter, he earns a bonus and is transported to another skyscraper, which presents more dangers than the past. The helicopter would only wait about 30 seconds, then fly off.

If the player completes all four skyscrapers, he is taken back to the first skyscraper and the game restarts from the beginning, but the player keeps his score."

The game replaced the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from ""cool"" to ""warm"", ""hot"", and ""critical"" status as it is used. Players can only defuse the ball, resetting it from its current state back to ""cool"" by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession, whether through touchdown, interception or fumble. A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball. The robots also possess finite durability. As offensive units are tackled, they wear down, finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits. A flaming robot will explode when hit, thereby fumbling the ball. Players can upgrade robots with faster and more durable units using money bonuses they earn during play. Players select from run, pass or option plays on offense, after which the computer presents four individual plays from which to choose. On defense, a player can select short, medium or long defenses, and then select a specific defensive scheme.
The standard Cyberball cabinet consists of two monitors, each with two sets of controls for a maximum of four players, but Atari Games released single player and two player versions as well.
The standard configuration allows single player, two player cooperative, two player head-to-head or four player head-to-head play. Playing with two teams of two persons opened up a new dimension of gameplay. Computer controlled avatars ran offensive patterns in very specific ways before reaching their assigned passing spots. Human players, however, could exploit the fact that a number of offensive plays started with identical formations. By choosing one play, but moving their avatars in imitation of a similar but different play, the offensive team could disguise their intentions before suddenly breaking for their assigned pass locations. This offensive flexibility forced defending players to quickly recognize plays and move to break them up by rushing to what they guessed was the intended passing spot. Most often, the timely use of the defender's turbo, a short-term speed boost usable once per play, would determine whether the play resulted in a missed pass, an interception, a long gain, or a score. This ability to improvise in four player mode built the popularity of Cyberball, leading to many tournaments across the United States for a period of time.
Cyberball was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992 by Jaleco. Tengen intended to release it unlicensed, but Jaleco purchased rights to publish it first. It has also been ported to numerous other platforms, including the Commodore Amiga, Atari Lynx and Sega Genesis."

The player controls a motorcycle and must cross the finish line before an established number of competitor bikes. The player must avoid crashing into obstacles, opposing racers, vehicles, and running out of gas. During a race there are certain areas where the player can refill their gas but stopping to refuel will cause competitor bikes to take advantage and race past the player. Competitors never run out of fuel but they are able to crash into obstacles thus taking them out of the race.

Occasionally during a race a helicopter will fly by dropping items that the player is able to pick up. The items are a 1000 Points Bonus, helper motorcycles that help you crash other racers, extra gasoline, Hi-grade gasoline which lasts longer than normal, a turbocharger that gives extra speed, and a helmet which provides invincibility.

Each scenario gives a different set number of units to use, which the player can mix and match between the different typese without going over that limit. When in a one-player game, the second controller can be used to modify the CPU forces. When playing against the CPU, the computer will be given a different ratio of units to command than the player. On the easiest scenario both the player and the CPU have the same amount of units, on all others the CPU will have more than the player. There is no variance in artificial intelligence, so the only thing that makes the later maps harder is the larger number of units the CPU has. The game is turn-based with no time limit. The object of the game is to destroy the enemy's headquarters unit. The player that does so first wins. Units have different mobility range, which varies according to the unit type and (except for aircraft) the terrain. They also have different shooting range, though this is fixed and not depends of the terrain. All unit types have limited ammunition and fuel. In order to replenish them the player must land them at the appropiate buildings; for example, all aircraft must stop at an airport in order to recharge their fuel and ammo supply. A certain unit is particularly strong or weak against a particular opponent, performing average against every other unit types."

In addition, by shooting at grids in the wall, John is able to climb in the vents, dropping into a designated spot or moving down or up a floor. At the start of the game, the player character can only use a pistol (with 15 bullets) and his fists to dispose of enemies, but later acquires several weapons, such as submachine guns, explosives and flashbangs which the terrorists can also use. When McClane is shot, a few picked up items can drop where he must pick them up again. However, bullets have minimal range, only shooting straight or on a 45 degree angle. McClane's health, which is drained by bullet wounds, can be restored by collecting soda cans from either enemies, snack machines (by shooting several bullets at them) or empty rooms. The player loses the game when all life is lost. The player has about four minutes before one of the six locks are opened, but can gain more time by destroying the main computer on the fifth level. Once all the locks have been opened, the vault is opened and the game's final battle is triggered. The player has only a few minutes to go to the 30th floor, for a final confrontation with Karl, Hans and any of the 40 terrorists left alive. One interesting aspect of the game allows the player to listen to Hans shouting orders to his guards through a two-way radio. However, after the second lock is opened, Hans will tell everyone to not use the radio. Also notable is the ""foot meter"". The meter starts out full, but will eventually decrease if the player character steps on shattered glass or runs around. If the meter becomes empty, McClane will walk much slower than he does when the foot meter is full. It can be restored by collecting med-kits. The game features cinematic sequences which change the story depending on which actions the player takes. For example, if there is fewer than one minute left and the player defeats Karl, the last scene with John and Holly will tell the player the roof has been destroyed by the helicopter sent by Hans."

Some found it easier to get through the course by using the NES Advantage, a joystick controller, rather than the NES' standard controller. The obstacles are all based on real obstacles from the show (with one exception) and are randomized before a game. They include The Tank, The 1-Ton Human Hamster Wheel, The Fireman's Flagpole, The Monkey Bars, ""Dallas"", Mount St. Double Dare, Moonwalk, and an original obstacle designed like a triangular jungle gym. ""Prizes"" for beating the obstacle course included a BMX bicycle, television set, an NES console, and several other gifts, ending with a exotic vacation -- though it can prove very difficult to get the best ""ending"" by completing the last obstacle.

It is often compared to The Legend of Zelda in terms of game play, but it is considerably more difficult due to the lack of clues or information on how to proceed.

The game is non-linear, and you must explore different territories in search of the eight stolen magical artifacts that maintain a sleep spell over a large and dangerous dragon. Enemies roam the overworld and dungeons, and must be defeated in order to earn experience points. Experience points are used to increase the player's level, which makes him stronger and gives him access to stronger weapons and magic. Most useful items are well hidden and, even when obtained, are difficult to determine their appropriate use. The game features a password system which allows you to continue play where you left off."

The game uses basic console role-playing game conventions, such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. Battle is turn-based like the other games in the series.
Dragon Warrior III features a class system, in which each character has a certain class. While the Hero always keeps the Hero class, the other characters can choose among the following: Soldier (Warrior in the GBC version), Fighter, Pilgrim (Cleric), Wizard (Mage), Merchant (Dealer), Goof-Off (Jester), Sage, and Thief which was available only in the later versions. The choice of class greatly affects the character's stats and spells he or she can learn. Furthermore, upon reaching experience Level 20, a character has the option of changing classes at the temple of Dhama, found halfway through the game. The game starts with just the Hero in the party, who then is able to recruit a party of three at the local tavern. Unlike most Dragon Quest parties, aside from the Hero, the party is not made up of characters involved in the story. Although only four characters can be in the party at a time, extra members of the party can be kept at the tavern, allowing room for new recruits. Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles.
The remakes incorporated some interface changes from later games in the series, such as simplified door opening; the bag, which replaced bank item storage; the item sorting ""Tidy Item"" and ""Tidy Bag"" commands; and the ""Full HP"" command, which can be used outside of combat to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells.
While the earlier Dragon Quest games were also non-linear, Dragon Quest III was the most substantial example of open-world gameplay among the early Dragon Quest games. It also allowed the player to swap characters in and out of the party at will, and another ""major innovation was the introduction of day/night cycles; certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at certain times of day."""

Riches of Elnark) is an adventure game developed and published by Towachiki. It presents the action from an overhead perspective, similar to many of the traditional 2D Zelda games.

It is unusual in that it tracks the player's behavior and adjusts a meter which indicates whether the player is generally more good (Light) or more evil (Dark). Though a more evil player has stronger abilities, players must air on the side of good in order to make significant advances through the game.

As a result, this game is considered extremely difficult, due to the unknown nature of how one should behave in order to proceed. If the player does not perform the correct actions, levels typically repeat themselves, and players find themselves stuck in the game with no clear method to advance. In fact, it was one believed that the only way to beat the game was to exploit a bug, however that has since been proven false."

The goal of the game is to defeat the evil demon Baal. However, the King first tests the player character by having them enter the dungeon beneath the castle and find a group of important quest objects. After completing this large dungeon, the protagonist officially becomes the Hero of God and can go defeat Baal by exploring the rest of the continent for some necessary magical scrolls and, eventually, special God-like equipment.

Players use the menu commands to interact with the world: moving around, looking around, picking up objects, talking to people, etc. The setting of this game is 20th century Japan.

In a novel twist, the two characters of Erika and Satoru (who are depicted as twin schoolchildren) are independently playable - either a single player switches between the two, or a second player takes over the second twin. Both characters need to be in the same region to converse with NPCs, but are otherwise free to explore the map autonomously. Two-player adventure games are very rare; even in Japan. However, only one person can partake in the animal quiz portion. Failing the quiz will force the player(s) to start from the beginning.

An odd bit of infamy related to this game is a secret developer's message that can be found if the player inputs a list of button presses after waiting some time after the game ends.

Evil Dead is a film franchise that began in 1981, followed by two sequels in 1987 and 1992 respectively. In 2013 a remake of the first part was made, and between 2015-2018 a direct sequel of the original saga was broadcast in series format, recovering Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams, the main character.

His legacy extends to comics, figures and, of course, video games, but it’s weird that at the top of his popularity no one (not even LJN) has ever licensed to make a Nintendo NES video game.

This hack fixes that, using the little known Splatter House installment for this console as a base. The original game is terribly cute (no kidding, even the cockroaches are cute in this game), so:

● Title screen edited using YY-CHR and some hex.

● 90% of the content has been redrawn from scratch. The other 10% (the one that fit well in the game but was too cute) has been modified to fit the new graphic style.

● Using the excellent translation of Spinner 8 & friends as a base, all texts have been modified to suit the new storyline.

● Some Easter eggs and cameos added just for fun.

● And much more! Just check it out and enjoy it!

The sensors inside would register the hits and transfer the information to the game, where the results of the player's punches would be shown on the screen.

The game itself is a fairly simplistic presentation of boxing, featuring a training and fight mode. Progress could be saved and restored via a password system. Fights were presented in first person perspective. There are only seven opponents, each in a different and increasing weight class. Naturally, they get stronger as the difficulty increases, and they become much harder to hit and knock down.

Just like the show, the object was to come up with answers to survey questions posed to 100 people. Correct answers were worth money, with $200 winning the game and the right to play Fast Money for $5,000, which was played exactly the same way as on the show (at least 200 points needed to win). $5 a point was awarded for unsuccessful playings of the round.
A player entered his answers by using the controller to scroll through the alphabet, contained in a string along the bottom of the screen; the answer had to be completed within a time limit. Reasonable similies to correct answers were accepted, and slight misspellings were also recognized.
Once a player won, they were given two options. The first was to stop playing, with the other being to continue on. A champion retired after winning over $20,000 automatically unless they were defeated.
If a computer-controlled family wins the game, no Fast Money is played with an excuse given to the form of ""Due to (EXCUSE), the (NAMES) will not be playing Fast Money today"". Excuses used include ""tax considerations"" and ""a birth in the family""."

However, 100 years later, Medeus is resurrected by the evil wizard Gharnef, who has conquered the mage-state of Khadein. The two form an alliance with the kingdoms of Macedon and Grust in order to conquer the world. Cornelius, the king of Altea and successor of Anri, takes up Falchion and leaves to battle them, leaving his son Marth and daughter Elice in the care of a bastion manned by Altea's ally, Gra. However, Gra betrays Altea to Dolhr; Cornelius is killed, Falchion is stolen, and Elice sacrifices herself so Marth can escape. Accompanied by a handful of knights, he takes refuge in the island nation of Talys.

Several years later, Marth repels a pirate invasion of Talys, leading its king to conclude that he is ready to battle Dolhr; he sends Marth out with several of his most trusted men and his daughter, Princess Caeda. Marth first rescues the kingdom of Aurelis and enlists the aid of its king's younger brother, Duke Hardin and his retainers. He meets Princess Nyna, the last survivor of the Archanean royal family and leader of the resistance against Dohlr. She gives him the Fire Emblem, a legendary treasure given to the hero destined to save the world. The two march to Archanea and free it from Grust's grasp. After briefly invading Khadein in search of Falchion, Marth retakes Altea. He learns that his mother was killed in the invasion and that Gharnef is holding Elice prisoner. Marth next battles Grust and their top general, Camus, who rescued Nyna from execution at Dohlrian hands; he chooses to uphold his honor as a knight of Grust, and Marth is forced to defeat him.

Marth is contacted by Gotoh, a wise old sage, who informs him that Gharnef wields the tome Imhullu, making him invincible; the only thing capable of defeating him is the magic of Starlight. Gotoh sends Marth to the Fane of Raman to find the materials needed to create Starlight; he also rescues the divine dragon, Tiki. Marth then invades Macedon and deposes the tyrannical King Michalis with the aid of Michalis' sister Minerva. There, Gotoh reforges Starlight. Marth invades Khadein once more, defeats Gharnef, reclaims Falchion, and rescues Elice. He then makes his way to Dohlr, battles, and defeats Medeus, returning peace to the land.

Players control a Japanese fleet of heavy cruisers, battleships, submarines and aircraft carriers.

A couple of things set this game apart from typical Famicom games. First, in addition to the cartridge and the manual, the game also came packaged with a large map and plastic models which represented ships and airplanes. The game never shows the entire state of the water, so it is up to the player to use the information that he or she has to update the representation of battle on the map using the plastic models. Second, no background music is heard while playing this game. Finally, this game makes use of a device known as the ""Turbo File,"" which was manufactured and sold by ASCII as well. This device was a hardware add-on for the Famicom which was used to save game progress. It was compatible with a number of other titles."

Players must throw tomatoes skillfully at a series of easy-to-hit targets. Some elements of the game are indirectly taken from the classic arcade game Pole Position (except that the player does not have the option to play as a Formula One vehicle).
In order to make it to the next level, the player must make it from the starting line to the finish within the time limit with a young child on inline skates. Otherwise, the player loses a chance and the player must start the stage over again. The host of the televised game show, J. D. Roth, congratulates players for winning a stage while taunting the player with late 1980s/early 1990s sarcasm when he loses a ""chance."" Icy floors and slime colored ramps offer an additional challenge to the player. There are 72 rooms in the entire Fun House; with targets that are either numbered or given a generic target graphic. Each room has a name that usually gives a clue about how the room's design is implemented. Although the player is given three chances to successfully navigate the entire Fun House, collecting 25 silver coins acts as a 1-up. Warp zones will allow players to access the more difficult levels of the Fun House at an earlier time; thus allowing gamers who are pressed for time a chance to beat the game with a higher level of risk."

The objective of Galaga is to score as many points as possible by destroying insect-like enemies. The player controls a starfighter that can move left and right along the bottom of the playfield. Enemies swarm in groups in a formation near the top of the screen, and then begin flying down toward the player, firing bombs at the fighter. The game ends when the player's last fighter is lost, either by colliding with an enemy or one of its bullets, or by being captured. Galaga introduces a number of new features over its predecessor, Galaxian. Among these is the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time, a count of the player's ""hit/miss ratio"" at the end of the game, and a bonus ""Challenging Stage"" that occurs every few levels, in which a series of enemies fly onto and out of the screen in set patterns without firing at the player's ship or trying to crash into it. These stages award a large point bonus if the player manages to destroy every enemy. Another gameplay feature new to Galaga is the ability for enemies to capture the player's fighter. While the player is in control of just one fighter, a ""boss Galaga"" (which takes two shots to kill) periodically attempts to capture the fighter using a tractor beam. If successful, the fighter joins the enemy formation. If the player has more lives remaining, play resumes with a new fighter. The captured fighter flies down with the enemy that captured it, firing upon the player just like normal enemies, and can be shot and destroyed. The player can free the fighter by destroying the boss Galaga while in flight, causing the captured fighter to link up with the player's current fighter, doubling his or her firepower but also making a target twice as large. Galaga has an exploitable bug that can cause the attackers to stop firing bullets at the player, due to a coding error. In addition, similar to the famous ""Split-Screen bug"" in Pac-Man, a bug exists in Galaga in which the game ""rolls over"" from Level 255 to Level 0. Depending on the difficulty setting of the machine, this can cause the game to stall, requiring that the machine be reset or power-cycled in order to start a new game."

"GeGeGe no Kitaro - Yokai Daimakyo","","Region Not Set","","Bandai Co., Ltd.","Tose Co., Ltd.","1986-04-17","1","No","Action","","GeGeGe no Kitaro - Yōkai Daimakyō, known as Ninja Kid in the West, is an NES game developed by TOSE and published by Bandai. It was based on the manga series GeGeGe no Kitaro.  This game was followed by a sequel titled Gegege no Kitarou 2: Youkai Gundan no Chousen, which was released the following year only in Japan also by Bandai.  It was the eighth best selling Famicom game of 1986, selling 1,250,000 copies.  

The original Japanese version is notably different from the American version (Ninja Kid). The main character is Kitarō, and his main weapon is his hair rather than darts. His sub-weapons are a flying finger instead of shuriken, his vest instead of the feather, and a geta instead of a boomerang. All of these weapons function the same as the ones of the protagonist of the American version, Kyo; they just use different sprites. The fireball sub-weapon remains the same. Certain levels are inhabited by ""western"" film monsters like Frankenstein's Monster and Count Dracula; the boss of these levels is the character Buckbaird, the leader of the ""western youkai"". The scroll which unlocks the fortress is a crystal ball in the original version. The familiars are also different, being characters from the manga: the Pegasus was originally Nurikabe, the Eagle was Konaki Jiji, and the Mirror was Sunakake Babaa. Finally, a few of the minor enemies are different; most notably the ""Pirate Ninja"" found in some of the Guerilla Warfare levels was originally Nezumi Otoko, and Kitaro rides on Ittan Momen during the Dog Fight levels."
"Gegege no Kitarou 2: Youkai Gundan no Chousen","","Region Not Set","","Bandai Co., Ltd.","Bandai Co., Ltd.","1987-12-22","1","No","Role-Playing","","Gegege no Kitarou 2: Youkai Gundan no Chousen (ゲゲゲの鬼太郎2 妖怪軍団の挑戦 ? Spooky Kitaro 2: Kitaro vs. Yokai Army) is a RPG game based on a manga and anime from Japan about a boy who is a youkai, a class of spirit-monster to which all of the main characters belong. The main character, Kitarou, is the last living member of a Ghost tribe. He is missing his left eye, but his hair usually covers the empty socket. He fights for peace between humans and yōkai, which generally involves protecting the former from the wiles of the latter. While the game follows the release of Gegege no Kitarou: Youkai Daimakyou (released in the U.S as Ninja Kid), it is not a direct sequel to the original game, which is an action side-scroller.

Gegege no Kitarou 2 plays very much like a simplified traditional RPG. Fights are turn-based, where the player must input his command, and then watch the sequence of event play out until the round is over and the next round begins. However, even though it is simplified, it is actually a rather difficult and challenging game. In the very beginning of the game, Kitarou struggles to survive more than two fights against monsters before needing to return home and rest until he reaches level 2. A majority of the enemies only provide experience points in the single digits until much later in the game, although to compensate, the amount of experience needed to reach each level is low by comparison as well. Kitarou maxes out at Level 10 when he reaches 999 experience points.

The map of the game's overworld is a fairly faithful representation of Japan, along with part of Korea and a small unidentified island. Kitarou must explore the island nation to rescue his girlfriend and the rest of the world from the onslaught of evil Youkai that threaten to take over the world of the living. He must locate several homes, castles, and cave entrances to make his way through Japan, which suffers from spirit storms that prevent him from exploring new regions on the island until some task has been completed first."

To do this, he must collect the keys which open the dock gates to each of the islands by invading several pirate ships and defeating the captain on board in combat. The gameplay on these pirate ships are taken directly from the arcade predecessor, with some small modifications.

Once Momotaru has collected a key from a pirate ship, he must then sail around the islands in search of the correct dock gate which the key corresponds to. Once there, the player embarks on an exploration of the island to find items, defeat a boss, and collect treasures before heading off in search of another island key.

Then a few years ago, a guy by the name of Jason, probably better known as NES-God, managed to put an order for a limited quantity of Huge Insect cartridges, somewhere between 10 and 20 pieces. As far as I know, these copies are the only ones to ever have been manufactured. However, at Sachen's new website, recently launched, Huge Insect now is available for ordering, but no one has successfully been able to place an order at all on their website.

Anyway, it seems like Huge Insect never had any real label art or box art made for it. All copies received by Jason were packed in generic Sachen boxes, of various colors. A badly made sticker/label of the Huge Insect titlescreen was put on the box and cartridge, looks like it was made on an inkjet color printer, using standard white paper.

Huge Insect plays a lot like the game Galaga, and will not run properly on a PAL NES system, even with the use of a converter. But it's quite playable and should be able to provide good fun :-)

The player has many choices of styles of the backing track, from popular styles such as Rock, Techno, and Jazz, to various ethnic flavors such as Bossa, Rio, Japan, India, Arabia, etc.

The backing tracks representing the styles use familiar elements to make the game more accessible to the general audience. For example, in the Scotland style Cadence to Arms, a familiar bagpipes tune, is used.

Most backing tracks loop around one or two chords, allowing an open improvisation on the main keyboard. Once the style is chosen, the main keyboard is masked in the way that only the scale that easily fits into the style is available, e.g. blues scale, pentatonic scale, etc.

The keyboard is controlled by the UP-DOWN or LEFT-RIGHT d-pads on the game controller so there is no way to play leaps in the scale.

The game is based on the arcade game and film of the same name. The resulting product differed from the arcade version in several aspects, but kept the same underlying premise and style.

By December 1988, there were two versions of the game available, distributed by Tengen and Mindscape, although the software itself was identical. After a lawsuit, Tengen's unlicensed version was pulled from the shelves and Mindscape's became the standard. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom gives the player control of Indiana Jones as he makes his way through the temple in a series of 12 levels or ""waves."" In the final wave, the player must defeat the villain of the film, Mola Ram, on a rope bridge that recreates the final scene in the movie. Reception of the game was generally negative.

Plot: 
The plot of the NES version follows the storyline of the original movie. At the onset of the game, Jones has just reached the Pankot Palace featured in the movie and is preparing to free the slave children, recover the missing Sankara Stones and defeat Mola Ram and his Thuggee entourage. The game differs from the original arcade version in many respects, including the layout and the manner in which one progresses through the game, but the plot remains unchanged in both versions.

The player advances through 12 levels (called ""waves""), the first nine of which require Jones to travel through the palace and recover the Sankara Stones. In these stages, the player may restart the game with all items intact in the last area reached. Afterwards, if the player dies, they must return to the Chamber of Kali (Wave 9) and finish the game from that point. Each level also has a timer that goes from 99 to zero. If time runs out, the player is confronted by Mola Ram and loses one life and all of their items. All levels also contain mine cart rooms, where Jones can ride the rails through the levels across hazards and past enemies."

"Jongbou","","Region Not Set","","K. Amusement Leasing Co.","Micronics","1987-07-18","","No","Puzzle","","Jongbou is a hybrid Mahjongg/block-breaking game developed by SNK and Micronics and released in Japan only for the Nintendo Famicom.

Jongbou is a combination of the popular Chinese board game Mahjong and a block-breaking game such as Breakout. Players bounce a ball around a Mahjong table filled with concealed tiles, with their goal being to dislodge the tiles and collect the ones they wish to add to their hand by passing underneath them as they fall. The stage is over either after all the tiles have fallen or the player has a winning hand.

The block-breaking aspect is simple: Simply direct the bouncing ball by hitting it with the paddle to first destroy the wall of betting tokens before reaching the hidden tiles. Hitting a tile once reveals it, allowing the player to strategically direct the ball so that they can collect the tile (if desired) and still catch the ball before it leaves the screen.

In addition, there are various power-ups that are mingled with the tiles. These have different characters than the dragons/seasons/flowers and provide different benefits, such as a partial wall to block the ball, forcefields that slow it down and special tiles that reveal all the remaining hidden tiles.

It should be noted that as useful as a tile might be towards obtaining a winning hand, it is not worth losing the ball (and subsequently a life) over.

Mahjong can seem a little convoluted, but it plays essentially like the card game rummy: The goal is to collect and discard tiles until the player has a hand that is comprised of Chows (straights of three, worth nothing but easier to obtain), Pungs (three-of-a-kind) and Kongs (four-of-a-kind, worth more than Pungs). The player normally has thirteen tiles in a hand, though this becomes fourteen tiles when they're in the process of discarding one. If those fourteen tiles comprise of Chows, Pungs and Kongs (and one pair) then it is a winning hand and the holder can declare Mahjong to win the round.

For the purposes of this game, much of the game's rules are unnecessary, including betting or indeed any of the multiplayer aspects. The goal is to simply put together a winning hand by collecting the right tiles as they drop. Tiles can range from ""Characters"" (a black symbol over a red symbol, actually Chinese numerical symbols for thousands), ""Bamboo"" (green sticks) and ""Wheels"" (black and red circles), as well as the three dragons (the red and green characters and the blank white tiles), the four seasons and four flowers. With the exception of the seasons and flowers, players need three (or four) instances of the same tile to score points."

"Jumbo Ozaki no Hole in One Professional","","Region Not Set","","HAL Laboratory, Inc.","HAL Laboratory","1988-02-01","2","No","Sports","","A golf sim for the NES developed by HAL Laboratory and released in 1988 in Japan only. It uses the likeness of prolific Japanese professional golfer Masashi ""Jumbo"" Ozaki.

HAL Laboratory, after creating many of Nintendo's golf games as a second party developer, decided to develop and publish their own golf title. Jumbo Ozaki no Hole in One Professional features the likeness of Japan's most prominent golf player, Masashi ""Jumbo"" Ozaki - the Jumbo nickname comes from his unusual height for a Japanese male: almost 6'. Though featured on the box art and in the title, Jumbo Ozaki makes no obvious appearance in-game.

Though by all practical metrics a perfectly standard overhead golf simulator - players take it in turn to get the ball to the hole in as few shots as possible, selecting the direction, club used and power of each shot - the game does do things a little differently than usual. Specifically, the visual cue for the power of the shot comes from the depiction of the golfer himself: The player must monitor the character as he swings, hitting the button at both the apex and nadir of the swing for maximum effect. This replaces the usual sliding power bar that most golf games have. Failure to hit the swing precisely will lead to slices and hooks.

The game can be played as a single player Stroke Match, which allows the player to practice on each of the game's 36 holes across two different courses. The player can also play against another human, or rate their score against CPU opponents in the 1 Day and 4 Day modes. The player can also adjust the difficulty, which makes wind speed a much more important factor."

"Kaettekita! Gunjin Shogi: Nanya Sore!?","","Region Not Set","","SOFEL Co., Ltd.","","1989-05-26","","No","Strategy","","A shogi game with a comedic military theme, released by Sofel for the NES in Japan only.

Kaettekita! Gunjin Shogi: Nanya Sore!? is a shogi game that uses the gunjin shogi, or military shogi, variant of the classic eastern chess-like board game. The player starts by selecting one of five opponents: A pumpkin-headed ghost, a werewolf Al Capone, an alien, Adolf Hitler or a sumo wrestler. The player is then given an assortment of pieces while the opponent appears to have the same number of instances of the same piece, though in truth their real forms are concealed from the human player. The player must use their wits to defeat the enemy's force of shogi pieces, which have different themes depending on the opponent the player has chosen (for instance, when fighting the pumpkin ghost both sides have vegetable-themed pieces).

When one of the player's pieces and an opponent's piece occupy the same space, a battle ensues: Some pieces will always win against other types, sort of like the rock-paper-scissors aspect of strategy games like Fire Emblem. If neither of the two pieces are weak to the other, both are eliminated. The goal is to figure out what pieces the opponent is attacking with and take them out - sometimes it is possible to ascertain what piece it is with how many spaces it can move, but the most reliable method is to see which pieces it is able to defeat, recalling its place on the rock-scissors-paper chain and then using a piece strong against it to finish it off.

The game, like all shogi simulators, was never released outside of Japan."

Taking a cue from Mega Man, he also now has the ability to slide through narrow spaces and underneath dangerous spikes.

Each stage contains numerous keys and locked doors. Any key will open any door, and it is possible to complete a stage without even finding all the keys and doors. The final door in each stage leads to the boss room. After clearing each stage, your performance is tallied, and depending on what you did, bonuses such as points or lives are given."

However, one victim named Takeshi Hongo escaped just before the final brainwashing. With his sanity and moral conscience intact, Hongo battled Shocker's minions as the grasshopper-themed altered human superhero Kamen Rider. Another of Shocker's victims, freelance photographer Hayato Ichimonji, had also been given cyborg implants, but was saved by Kamen Rider from the brainwashing process to become Kamen Rider #2.

Koushien is the first game in K Amusement's Koushien series of baseball games that focuses on the highschool level of competition. Koushien refers to the stadium where the final of the national highschool league takes place. It takes a leaf from the book of many other NES/Famicom baseball games, like Namco's Family Stadium, by depicting the batsman at the bottom of the screen and the pitcher at the top. Though it has realistically proportioned athletes, the presentation and idle animations are somewhat comical and the game overall leans on an arcade experience rather than being super realistic.

Koushien was followed by multiple sequels, however the first game was the only one in its series to be released on the original Famicom. Future games would appear on the Super Famicom and PlayStation as well as other, newer consoles. This game would go on to be the basis of SNK's Little League Baseball: Championship Series."

"Labyrinth","Labyrinth Maou no Meikyuu","Region Not Set","","Activision","Tokuma Shoten Intermedia","1987-01-07","1","No","Action","","Labyrinth was released for the Famicom under its Japanese title, Labyrinth Maou no Meikyuu, which can be loosely translated as Labyrinth: Maze of the Goblin King. It is based on the 1986 film of the same name which was directed by Jim Henson, produced by George Lucas, and featuring David Bowie as Jareth the Goblin King, and Jennifer Connelly as Sarah Williams. Although it was published by Activision, who held the world right publishing rights to video game adaptations of the movie, it is distinctly different from the version of Labyrinth which was developed by Lucasfilm Games (now LucasArts), and published by Activision for the Commodore 64/128, Apple II, and MSX2.

15 year old Sarah is so resentful of her baby brother Toby that she hopes he will just disappear. Her dream becomes reality when goblins kidnap the boy—but Sarah unexpectedly finds herself horrified by the loss. So she sets forth to retrieve him, and finds herself on the adventure of a lifetime. To accomplish her task, she will somehow have to reach the center of the fantastical labyrinth where the wicked Goblin King has imprisoned the lad. But the task is easier said than done, for the maze is filled with strange creatures and mind-bending puzzles that confuse the girl.

While the film was fairly successful in the United States, it developed a rather large following in Japan. Developed Tokuma Shoten created this action-adventure game that was more accurate to the film than the Lucasfilms Games version. The gameplay employed a top-down view similar to The Legend of Zelda, and featured many interesting tricks and puzzles, including levels that played with spatial relationships. Walking through certain avenues found in the levels would seamlessly warp you to another location in the level without any noticeable indication; the surrounding environment of the destination was designed to match the environment of the origin completely. Instead of using a health meter, a running clock displays how much time is remaining, and contact with enemies removes bits of time."

Eight different asteroids have to be explored before being able to rescue Layla's best friend.[2] Each asteroid is divided into two sections; the first part involving the surface of the asteroid while the second part deals with the actual enemy base.

There is an equally large mechanical element to the level as there is a biological element. The screen always scrolls from left to right. No backtracking is permitted on any level. While navigating through the cavern-like interiors of the asteroids, enemies must be defeated and password disks must be retrieved. At the final room of each asteroid lies a boss that must be defeated before being able to move on. Several guns in addition to some hand grenades can be used to destroy the bad guys impeding Layla's progress. The handgun is the player's initial weapon; but more powerful weapons can be found just by exploring. Certain blocks can be broken by using the player's chosen weapon; the difference between destroyable blocks and non-destroyable blocks is sometimes indistinguishable.

Bonus levels distributed throughout the game allows players to destroy entire squadrons of enemy ships while being completely impervious to their attacks. Players must be wary that every weapon has a limited amount of bullets; players can possess more than one sub-weapon at a time. When Layla's life reaches zero, she dies and immediately loses a life.

"Lot Lot","","Region Not Set","","Tokuma Shoten Publishing Co., Ltd.","Irem Corp.","1985-12-21","","No","Puzzle","","A strategy/puzzle game by Tokuma Shoten Publishing. The goal is to use a pair of arrows to teleport pachinko balls around a maze to the scoring zones, and away from the ""Out"" zone. It was originally developed for Arcades and ported to MSX and the Famicom.

Lot Lot is a puzzle game involving pachinko balls and has a superficiality similarity to that popular Japanese gambling game. Instead of firing the balls around a table full of pins that change their course, the goal is to make sure the balls run into one of the four troughs that score points, with the higher numbered scoring zones being preferable. If any drop into the ""Out"" zone, the game is over.

Tokuma Shoten Publishing is a major conglomerate in Japan that mostly publishes magazines, though in the 80s they tried branching out into other mediums as well. Lot Lot is one of their earliest forays into publishing video games, and is the first game of theirs to be published for the NES/Famicom.

The player changes the destination of these balls with a pair of arrows: A pink arrow and a green arrow. Pressing the action button will switch the contents of the two boxes the two arrows are hovering over. The pink arrow goes where the player directs and the green allow follows the same path with a slight time delay. The idea is to pass over the first box that the player wants to teleport balls from and move over to a second box they wish to teleport to, and waiting until the green arrow passes over the original box before pressing the button. The walls of the maze will randomly open and close for limited durations, so the player must send the right balls to the right box quickly in order for them to drain into the scoring zones (or lure them away from draining into the Out zone). The longer the player is able to do this, the more points they will score."

"Mahjong","","Region Not Set","","Nintendo","Nintendo","1983-08-27","","No","Sports","","You can enjoy the thrill and excitement of playing Mahjong yourself against the computer.

There are 3 levels - Beginner, Intermediate and Expert - which are selected according to the skill of the player. It's great for practicing! Especailly, in the higher skill level, there are time limits (approximately 12 seconds) which enables you to enjoy speedy game plays. Also, it automatically calculates and displays the score on the screen.

Mahjong is a game based on the popular Chinese table game of the same name. It was released by Nintendo for the Famicom and Famicom Disk System, and was one of the earliest titles for both systems.

Mahjong (stylized on cart as ""MAH-JONG"") is a video game simulation of the board game of the same name, a tile-based multiplayer game that is similar to the card game Rummy. Nintendo themselves developed and published the game and it was one of the very first original games created for the Famicom/NES system, along with Gomoku Narabe Renju (another board game adaptation). The game was later adapted for the Famicom Disk System. It was never released outside of Japan.

Mahjong follows the popular Japanese ""Riichi"" rule set and is adapted for play against a single CPU opponent. Three different modes are available (in order from top to bottom):

Beginner - No timer or penalties
Intermediate - No timer; a 12,000 point chombo penalty is imposed for calling an invalid win
Advanced - A 10-second limit is imposed, chombo applies; CPU is more aggressive

A full game consists of three matches, each consisting of East and South rounds, each round further consisting of East and South winds (West and North are not played, so rounds progress after only two dealer changes). The player with the highest point total at the end of each match is declared the winner of that match, and the best of three matches is declared winner at the end of the game.

Left/Right and A are used to draw, select, and discard tiles. Up/Down and B are used to select and make calls.

Other gameplay notes and special rules:

It is not possible to go bust; rounds continue even if a player's score drops into the negatives, and Riichi can still be called with less than 1,000 points.
The Dora and Ura-Dora indicators are the Dora tiles themselves, not the next in sequence.
Red Dora tiles are not used.
In all modes, there is a 3-second window after the final discard to declare a win; even if the final discard is a winning tile, the game will automatically end the round if the player does not call in time.
Tenpai payments are 1,500 instead of 3,000.
Ryanshi (two yaku minimum) is enforced after 5 honba.
The honba counter counts up to 9, but rounds can continue beyond that with the counter looping around to 0. With only two players, high honba counts are common."

The protagonist Yusaku Godai is a struggling student staying at the titular boarding house.

The game adaptation was originally released for the PC98-01 and MSX in 1986 before being ported to various other Japanese home computers, including also the Nintendo Famicom in 1988 and the PC Engine (TurboGrafx-16) in 1989.

It was developed by Imagineer and was never released outside of Japan.

Matsumoto Tooru no Kabushiki Hisshou Gaku (""Matsumoto Tooru's Stock Success Knowledge"") is a stock exchange simulation developed and published by Imagineer. The goal of the game is to make 100 million yen (approximately $1.3mil) in the stock market in the span of a single year via a series of shrewd financial decisions and listening to advice about which way a certain type of stock might turn.

The game is fronted by Matsumoto Tooru, a nationally well-known financial adviser who is often considered to have an expansive knowledge of the Japanese stock market. The game also features the song ""The Entertainer"" by Scott Joplin.

Though it focused on unusually complex subject matter for a video game, it sold enough copies to inspire a sequel that was released the following year."

It's Mega Man versus the powerful leaders and fighting forces of Monsteropolis - that strange multi-layered land of robot-like humanoids created by the wrongly-performed experiments with human beings by Dr. Wily.

Mega Man - the chosen defender of the human race. For he dares to single-handedly penetrate Monsteropolis' seven separate societies to stop the rapid expansion of strange misrepresentations of humans.

Mega Man's goal is monumental. He must infiltrate seven separate heavily-guarded empires. By himself, he must break down and destroy the following empire leaders: Cutman, Gutsman, Iceman, Bombman, Fireman, Elecman, and Dr. Wily.

The action involves Mega Man armed only with laser beam weapons, encountering strangely-configured humanoids. They're atop, in and out of fortified prison-like structures strengthened with thick walls. Hidden amid gun turrets embedded in concrete uprights, even in subterranean passages below icefields. WOW!

Will you and Mega Man penetrate the seven separate societies of Dr. Wily and preserve the human race? You're in control!"

"Mega Man [5 Screw]","","NTSC","United States of America","Capcom USA, Inc.","Capcom","1987-12-24","1","No","Action | Platform","E - Everyone","Mega Man consists of six side-scrolling action platformer levels freely chosen by the player. In each level, the player-character, Mega Man, fights through various enemies and obstacles before facing a ""Robot Master"" boss at the level's end. Upon defeating the boss, the player assimilates the Robot Master's signature attack, or ""Special Weapon"", into Mega Man's arsenal for the rest of the game. Unlike the standard Mega Buster (Rock Buster in Japan), the Robot Master powers have limited ammunition replenished by collecting ammunition cells dropped by defeated enemies at random. Enemies also drop energy cells that replenish Mega Man's health gauge. Though the player is free to proceed through the game in any order, each Robot Master is especially vulnerable to a specific weapon, which encourages the player to complete certain stages before others. The player can revisit cleared levels. Besides the weapons taken from the Robot Masters, the player is able to pick up a platform generator item known as the ""Magnet Beam"" in Elec Man's stage.

Mega Man features a scoring system where players score points for defeating enemies, and earn extra points for collecting power-ups from fallen enemies and for clearing each stage. Each Robot Master was worth a random number between 50,000 and 100,000 points whereas Dr. Wily was always worth 200,000 points. The scoring system was removed in later Mega Man games as it was found to provide no meaningful benefit to players and felt unnecessary to designers.

When all six Robot Master stages are completed, the seventh and last stage appears in the middle of the stage select menu. This stage, in which the player traverses Dr. Wily's robot factory, is a chain of four regular stages linked together, each containing at least one new boss. During these final stages, the six Robot Masters must also be fought again in a predetermined order before the final confrontation against Dr. Wily. As Mega Man's ammo is not restored between stages, every action the player takes is consequential."

The actual running happens automatically: the job of the player is to avoid the obstacles and collect the cans by moving the Runner with the stick and adjusting his speed accordingly.

If the Runner finishes the round within the time limit, the remaining time will be awarded to him as bonus points and he will proceed to the next round. Every fourth round is special, using the remaining time from the three previous ones as additional time. However, if the Runner has not finished the round by the time the time limit runs out, he will be electrocuted and the game will immediately be over.

Obstacles along the way include Slip Zones which will slow the Runner down if he tries to cross over them, Pitfalls which will break under the Runner's weight and drop him into the holes beneath them, and Crackers which will launch the Runner up into the air and cause him to land on his back. Later rounds also feature Jumbo Tires that bounce towards the Runner, Walls that emerge from the ground before receding back into it, Cubes that move through particular columns of tiles, Mice that attempt to jump onto the Runner and slow him down, and Chess Knights and Kings that bounce from one tile to another.

The rounds also feature Springboards, which can be used to propel the Runner forward at a great speed. Some rounds have a special layout of Springboards, where it is possible to use one Springboard to land directly on the second one. Some other rounds also feature Skateboards which will speed the Runner up and make him immune to Slip Zones. There are also two different types of drink cans; kicking them will either gain the player bonus points (from 100 to 5000) or speed the Runner up, but jumping on them will stop the timer for a few seconds."

Metroid was released in North America for the NES in 1987. It was the first Metroid game to be released in the series. The game has a re-release in 2004 for Game Boy Advance then 3 years later in 2007 for the Virtual Console on the Wii. The gameplay of Metroid, which focuses on exploring and searching for upgrades to help collect items in previous areas, was a major influence for other games. It was also made popular for speedrunning to get fast time completions for the various endings. Metroid was praised for being one of the earliest games to have the protagonist as a woman. The player will need to beat the game in less than five hours to reveal this. The English manual even refers to the main character as ""he"". Game Informer ranked this game 7 out of 100 in their top 100 list.

Metroid is first chronologically in the Metroid universe. The Space Pirates end up attacking a space research vessel owned by the Galactic Federation to steal Metroid craeture samples. A Metroid is a floating organism that is dangerous and latches onto another organism to drain their energy, killing the other organism. The plan that Space Pirates intend to do is replicate the Metroids by using beta rays on them. This will turn them into biological weapons that Space Pirates will use to kill any living beings opposing them. The Galactic Federation located the Space Pirate Base on planet Zebes while they were looking for the Metroids that were stolen. The Federation tried to attack the planet but were resisted by th Pirates, forcing a retreat.
The Federation decided to go with their last resort, which was to send a single bounty hunter to infiltrate the Pirate base to annihilate the Mother Brain. Mother Brain is a biomechanical creature controlling the Pirate Base and their defenses. The Federation chose to send Samus Aran, who is considered the best bounty hunter in existence. After landing on planet Zebes, Samus starts exploring the planet by traversing the caverns on Zebes. While on the mission, she runs into Kraid, who is a Space Pirate ally. She then later finds Ridley, who is the commander of the Space Pirates. She defeats both of them. Samus finally finds the Mother Brain and destroys it. Upon destroying the Mother Brain, Samus sete a bomb with a timer set at 99.9 seconds. She then escapes the planet, leaving the lair in pieces.

The player takes control of Samus Aran for the mission on Zebes. The planet is open world with the areas connected with elevators and doors. Samus begins with a power beam that is weak and her only firearm. She also has the ability to jump. While exploring the caverns, the player will find and collect upgrades that will give Samus enhanced abilities and better her weaponry and armor. These upgrades will allow Samus to access previous areas that were not accessible. Some of the upgrades the player can get for Samus include Morph Ball, allowing Samus to change to a ball and roll into small tunnels, the Bomb, which is used while in the ball form and sets a small explosive that can open a hidden floor or wall path, and the Screw Attack, which is a somersault attack that can destroy almost any enemy in their path.

On top of the common enemies, the player will encounter the two bosses Kraid and then Ridley. Both of them will need to be defeated, with Kraid coming first and Ridley second in the gameplay. When regular enemies are destroyed, they will leave ammo for missiles or energy pellets to refill Samus’s life. The player can upgrade Samus’s maximum health and carrying capacity by finding energy tanks marked with an E and missile tanks. Defeating bosses will also help with upgrades. When the player defeats both Kraid and Ridley, the pathway near the start of the game will open, giving access to the last area. While going to confront Mother Brain, the player will need to fend off Metroids by freezing them with the Ice Beam and then shooting them with missiles."

The original Metroid manual tells us about a deep-space research ship that was attacked. The Space Pirates seized a capsule said to contain a previously unknown life form in a state of suspended animation. Rogue Dawn surrounds these events that led up to the theft of the capsule, which ultimately placed the Metroids under the control of Ridley and the Mother Brain. The mission to acquire the capsule was placed in the hands of one of Ridley’s best-kept secrets: a rogue human agent, trained and manipulated by Ridley from a young age…

Taken as a child from a Galactic Federation colony obliterated by Ridley’s faction, she was initially just another test subject slated to undergo horrific experiments. Ridley decided to instead manipulate and mold her into a weapon, his first human servant and dark agent. Primed yet untested, she is sent out on her own “zero” mission. She will retrieve a newly-discovered biological specimen in the possession of a Federation research crew orbiting planet SR388 and prove her worth.

The Island Caper plays almost identically to the original Spy vs Spy game, just with a graphically updated island theme. Instead of rooms full of fixtures that items might be hidden behind, the player must search beaches on islands for items buried in the sand. Specifically, they need to assemble a missile from its parts, presumably so it can be launched at the opponent spy's home country. Finding the missile will allow the victorious spy to escape the island via a submarine (which inexplicably also includes an attractive woman). There are also traps which, like in the original, can be placed in spots where missile parts might be to fool opponents into killing themselves.

My previous patch addressed the first two problems, fixed the damage and you never run out of continues. This patch finally tackles the final piece, passwords.

The US version had all password program code removed. So I started from scratch and devised my own password program code. It works well, and the passwords match the Japanese version’s passwords. This finally is the definite version of NG3 to play. The original US release and Ninja Gaiden Trilogy release all have drawbacks to the Japanese version, and this patch is on par with the Japanese version, or better since it is in English.

This hack is an addendum to the “Ninja Gaiden III - Restored” hack. MottZilla’s hack did a lot to revert the changes of the U.S. version of Ninja Gaiden III, but it left a few things intact and this patch aims to revert those as well.

MottZilla’s original hack fixes enemy damage, unlimited continues, and adds a new password system to match the Famicom release.

This patch focuses on a few additional changes, namely:
- The enemy spawn and item pickup locations, counts, and types have been changed to match the Famicom version.
- Ryu now respawns at the beginning of the stage he died on, to match the Famicom.
- Spikes and quicksand now do 3 bars of damage (more information on this in the readme.txt).

Princess Sakura has been kidnapped by Damazu-Dayuu, and because Ninja-Kun is away on a journey, the task falls to young JaJaMaru-kun.

In the game, the player starts with three lives and can only run, jump and throw shurikens. The game is divided into stages, each with four floors and eight enemies. Sakura-Hime and Damazu are placed, unreachable, at the top of the screen. Enemies use various projectiles, one of which will cause the player to lose a life. If JaJaMaru-kun lands on top of an enemy, it will simply be temporarily stunned and vice versa. Once an enemy is defeated and offscreen, a spirit will appear and ascend to the top of the screen. It can be collected before it has disappeared to receive points, which vary depending on the enemy. Sakura will sometimes drop petals that the player can collect, and Damazu will sometimes run around, dropping bombs. To advance to the next stage, the player must defeat all eight enemies by using shurikens.

Some bricks yield items. They include:

    A cart that temporarily makes JaJaMaru-kun invincible and faster. Projectiles and enemies will also be destroyed if touched.
    A bottled substance that makes JaJaMaru temporarily invincible and able to walk through enemies.
    A red ball that increases speed.
    Bombs (which must be avoided).

This is the third entry in the series of fast-paced ninja action games, and is the last game in the series to be released on the Nintendo Entertainment System.

Some time has passed since the defeat of Ashtar and the resurrected Jaquio, and Irene Lew has received a new mission to complete. She is to observe a strange factory that has been constructed recently for an unknown purpose, and investigate it. She proceeds to reconnoiter it, but is intercepted and apparently assassinated by her friend Ryu Hayabusa...except it isn't Ryu. It is an imposter. The real Ryu, angered over her death, and the subsequent false accusation that he murdered her, continues her mission and proceeds to investigate the factory.

As stated, this was the last game in the regular series produced for the NES. It had many features the previous games in the series did not, such as a power up to extend the length of your sword, a new vertical ""wave"" attack and vertically-scrolling levels. The US version of the game is reputed to be the hardest in the series, due to the extra damage incurred when hit, slightly shorter regular sword length, limited continues and more enemies.

The Lynx port is the second Ninja Gaiden game on the platform, the first being a port from the Arcade Version. This port is identical to the NES game, but the in-game picture is compressed for the smaller screen of the Lynx."

However, the other enemies can still kill the mother cat like the fish merchant (who is the only humanoid bad guy in the game), the automobiles on the road, along with the manholes and the pylons.

Sewer snakes also come out to kill the player with its poisonous venom. Triangle cones can momentarily block progress for the player.

"Paris-Dakar Rally Special!","","Region Not Set","","CBS/Sony Group Inc.","ISCO","1988-02-01","","No","Action","","A NES game based on the famed Paris-Dakar Rally, developed by ISCO. While ostensibly a racing game, the style of gameplay tends to change per level.

Paris-Dakar Rally Special! is an unusual racing game in which the player must successfully win the Paris-Dakar Rally. However, in order to do so, the player is faced with a wide variety of odd challenges to overcome, a scant number of which actually involve racing.

Developed by ISCO for the NES, Paris-Dakar Rally is notorious for its bizarre structure. Depending on who is asked it is either a testament to the NES library's occasionally creative and off-beat ingenuity, or a legendary ""kusoge"" (crap game).

Stage 1 - Preparation
In the first stage the player is without vehicle. In order to race in the Paris-Dakar Rally, the player must first acquire a sponsor, some money, a car and a navigation partner. In order to achieve these objectives, the player must walk around town and talk to the right order of sponsors, executives, bank tellers and rally co-ordinators to begin. Once the car has been purchased and a navigation partner chosen (which is resolved with a fast reactions mini-game), the player can take a plane to Paris to begin the rally.

Stage 2 - First Day
The first day races most closely resemble an actual racing game. The player has a top-down view of a vertically-scrolling track and must control the car's speed and direction with the D-pad. In order to qualify for the next stage of the event, the player must make it through the course within a time limit while dodging hostile vehicles from behind and in front. Losing three lives restarts the stage.

Stage 3 - Second Day
This mode more closely resembles the Arcade game Rally-X. The player must maneuver and corner around the Parisian streets in order to avoid rival drivers. They can distract pursuing CPU opponents by dropping rubber balls (possibly tires) behind the player's car to deter them.

Stage 4 - Third Day
The action changes to a side-scrolling perspective and now the player must contend with birds dropping deadly eggs, bridges that collapse once driven on, rolling boulders, fires and other obstacles on the racecourse. Occasionally, the player will need to leave the vehicle in order to hit a switch to extend a bridge before they can continue.

Stage 5 - Fourth Day
As the player is on a variant of the Paris-Dakar course that will inconveniently cross a major sea, the player must steer their car-boat over and under the ocean and avoid various hostile sea creatures and jagged rocks.

Stage 6 - Fifth Day
Into the Dakar desert, the player must drive vertically up the screen while avoiding vicious desert animals like snakes, scorpions, spiders, camels and other hostile racers. The player must also contend with some narrow walls and a section where they must cross between two rafts.

Stage 7 - Sixth Day
At some point between starting the race and the sixth day, World War 3 broke out and the player must use their newly mounted machine guns to take down the enemy aircraft and tanks between them and the finishing line.

Stage 8 - Final Day
The Dakar finish line is just ahead, all the player must do is survive a gauntlet similar to that of the First Day. As with that stage, the player must be alert for other racers all around them and make it to the end within the time limit."

Not only are the elements of the board game there, but so are several picture-based mini-games. Additionally, this version can be played solo, whereas the board game requires at least three people. 

The basic objective of Pictionary is for a person on a team to try and illustrate a word he or she has been given using only drawings. The team must guess what is being illustrated within a certain amount of time. As a reward for guessing the puzzle correctly, the team gets to advance on a board. The team that makes it to the end of the board first wins. 

In addition to the classic drawing aspect to the game, there are also four mini-games to be played in order for a team to win. These include ""Attack of the Paint Zombies"" (similar to Space Invaders), ""The Warehouse Shuffle"" (moving crates from one side of a warehouse to another as gremlins try to steal them), ""Four Alarm Rescue"" (catching people as they jump out of windows), and ""Leapin' Energy Casules!""

"Pinball","ピンボール","NTSC-J","Japan","Nintendo","Nintendo R&D1","1984-02-02","1","No","Action","E - Everyone","The player controls the paddles of a virtual pinball machine. Two screens represent the traditional pinball table plus a bonus mode. The player launches a ball with the plunger from the first screen—the bottom of the pinball table—through the top of the screen to the second screen. Play moves to the first screen if the ball falls through the bottom of the top screen and returns to the top screen if the ball is hit back through the space at the top of the first screen. The player controls the flippers on either screen to deflect the ball to keep it from falling off the bottom of the lower screen.

Pinball has a secondary Breakout-like mode, which the player reaches by hitting the ball into a bonus hole that takes the player to a bonus stage to control Mario carrying a platform. The object of this mode is to rescue Pauline who had debuted with Mario in Donkey Kong (1981). The player achieves this by bouncing the ball off Mario's platform and hitting various targets, the destruction of which also earns points. When the blocks under her are all gone, she will drop. Catching her on Mario's platform earns bonus points, but allowing her to hit the ground causes the player to lose."

Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken (The Portopia Serial Murder Case), is an adventure game created by Yuji Horii and published by Enix (now Square Enix). First conceived in 1981, it was released on the NEC PC-6001 in June 1983, and later ported to other personal computers.

The game is an investigation adventure, sophisticated for its time, in which the player must resolve a murder mystery by searching for clues, exploring different areas, interacting with characters, and solving item-based puzzles. The game, especially its NES version, was received positively in Japan, where it was an influential title that defined the visual novel genre, in addition to paving the way for the seminal Dragon Quest series of console role-playing games as well as inspiring new game designers such as Hideo Kojima.

It is the first entry in the Yuji Horii Mysteries trilogy. It was followed by Hokkaidou Rensa Satsujin: Ohotsuku ni Kiyu!! in 1984 and Karuizawa Yuukai Annai in 1985.

"Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '87","Pro Baseball Family Stadium '87","Region Not Set","","Namco","Namco","1987-12-22","","No","Sports","","Not so much a sequel to Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium than an enhanced rerelease with updated rosters. It was published by Bandai for the Famicom in late 1987.

Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '87 is the second game in Namco's long running Family Stadium series, also known as Famista. It's a traditional baseball game that allows one human player against the CPU, two competing human players and two competing CPU players in a ""Watch"" spectator mode.

Rather than being a full sequel to Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium the game is instead an updated version of the original, which was reflected in its lower price at release. It adds a few features and updates the official rosters for the athletes, but is functionally identical to the original Family Stadium. This specific type of annualization would become common practice for sports game franchises such as Madden NFL and NHL.

It's worth noting that this game is unrelated to R.B.I. Baseball 2 from Tengen. The original R.B.I. Baseball and Family Stadium were one and the same, the former receiving a name change to appeal to a Western audience, but after that initial game both franchises diverged. R.B.I. Baseball specifically favored more realistic looking athlete sprites while Family Stadium would persist with the cartoonish ""super deformed"" sprites."
"Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '88","","Region Not Set","","Namco","Namco","1988-12-20","2","No","Sports","","Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '88 is the third in Namco's Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium series. As with its immediate predecessor, Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '87, it is a slightly revamped version of the original with updated rosters. As with EA Sports's present-day practice, Namco released these games annually with little to distinguish each new iteration. Most notable of the smattering of minor new additions is allowing the player to choose their venue from four options, ranging from a fully-packed stadium to a park.

Though this is the second sequel to Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium, which was released in the US by Tengen as R.B.I. Baseball, Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '88 is not to be confused with R.B.I. Baseball 3. Though the first R.B.I. Baseball was a direct localization, subsequent R.B.I. Baseball games were created in the US and are entirely independent from Namco's series."
"Pro Yakyuu? Satsujin Jiken!","","Region Not Set","","Capcom","Capcom","1988-12-24","","No","Adventure","","A comedic adventure game that satirizes the heavy number of baseball and murder mystery games for the Famicom. It was developed and published by Capcom in Japan only.

Pro Yakyuu? Satsujin Jiken! (""Pro Baseball? Murder Case!"") is a slightly tongue-in-cheek parody of the Famicom's overabundance of Portopia style murder mystery adventure games and baseball simulators, especially the annual Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium releases.

It was developed and published by Bandai in 1987 for the Famicom.

The story of the game draws heavily from the first story arc of the series, from the beginning of the story to the fight with the Gold Saints. The game remains faithful to the original story while introducing some original elements. When the game came out, the story line was in the middle of the Gold Saints story arc. As a result, the last boss of the game is an original character. The actual final fight of the Gold Saints arc was carried over into this game's sequel, Saint Seiya: Ougon Densetsu Kanketsu Hen.

The gameplay mixes side scrolling action scenes to transport the character from place to place where he may have to jump over obstacles and fight basic enemies, with a turn based combat system against bosses and other significant battles. In order to be successful at these turn based battles, the player must distribute his power, or Cosmos, to various attributes before each attack. Failure to do so typically results in no damage dealt to the opponent, and a lot of damage received. When Life is lost, the main character can be revived, but if all Cosmos is lost, then the game is over."

As with the original game, the story draws heavily from the first story arc of the series. This version picks up where the original left off, with the Bronze Saints about to take on all twelve of the Gold Saints in order to save Saori before time runs out. The game remains faithful to the original story, to the extent that your options are limited if you try to choose match ups that didn't occur in the show.

The gameplay mixes side scrolling action scenes where a saint must survive long enough to reach a particular Gold Saint's temple, with a turn based combat system against the Gold Saints. In order to be successful at these turn based battles, the player must distribute a pool of Seven Senses to a Saints Life and Cosmos. When Life is lost, certain Saints can be revived under certain conditions, but many are taken out of play. Other Saints and characters become available at particular points along the story."

Satomi Hakkenden (usually translated as ""The Eight Dog Chronicles"") was a long-running 19th century novel series about eight samurais from the Sengoku period and their various adventures. It was in some ways partly inspired by the ancient Chinese epic The Water Margin, which has itself seen video game adaptations in the form of the Suikoden games. Receiving numerous TV and film adaptations, including the 1983 film known in the west as Legend of the Eight Samurai, Satomi Hakkenden would be its first video game adaptation. Makai Hakkenden Shada for the Turbografx-16, also released in 1989, would be a later adaptation.

The game itself plays much like Dragon Quest; a common source of inspiration for 8-bit RPGs. The player can walk around towns conversing with NPCs, equipping themselves with weapons and armor and receiving quests and directions to new areas before leaving the safety of the town to fight random encounters on the overworld map that links locations together. Combat follows the tactical turn-based pattern, allowing the player input their characters' desired actions before watching each turn play out.

As he begins his adventure, the caveman relies on small rocks in order to defend himself against the various enemies coming his way.

Two secret icons are also available throughout the game, and can only be revealed by shooting at the same hidden and invisible locations multiple times - the bird gives the player little wings and the ability to temporary fly, and the Riki icon turns the player into a large wrestler with considerable powers.

Though most of the Moero!! Pro Yakyuu games were released in the US as Bases Loaded, this one was not.

Shin Moero!! Pro Yakyuu (New Burning!! Pro Baseball) is the sixth of Jaleco/TOSE's Moero!! series of sports games (it's occasionally referred to as Moero 6!! Shin Moero!! Pro Yakyuu) and the third in the series to be associated with baseball. The first two Moero!! Pro Yakyuu games saw localizations in the US as Bases Loaded and Bases Loaded 2, but Shin Moero!! Pro Yakyuu was skipped. What eventually became Bases Loaded 3 was instead the fourth Moero!! Pro Yakyuu game, Moero 8!! Pro Yakyuu '90 Kandouhen.

The biggest difference between the previous Moero!! Pro Yakyuu/Bases Loaded games and this one is the slanted perspective for batting and pitching. Instead of the camera being behind the batter or pitcher, the player can see both from an angle, with the two situated diagonally from each other. Likewise, the baseball diamond is shown at an angle making it appear more like a square, with the rest of the field stretching outwards. Despite this new perspective, the game controls similarly to previous Bases Loaded games.

A curious addition is that of the biorhythms, which tells the player how each athlete is feeling: If the athlete is having an off-game, one or more of these biorhythms will be low and the player will need to strategize around these dips. Though big in 70s sports punditry, the idea of mathematical biorhythms predicting an athlete's prowess in any upcoming game was all but discredited as pseudoscience by the time when this game came out."

The 1975 novel that Shogun is based on, also called Shogun, details the rise of a fictional Daimyo Toranaga over many years, as he rises in power to become the military leader of a Japan united under his rule. The story is told from the perspective of a foreign sailor.

The game allows players to assume the role of Toranaga or one of his rivals and assist them in becoming Shogun. This is done by walking through areas and finding ways of drawing others to the player character's cause, or simply eliminating them if the former path is not an option. It was developed by Virgin Interactive for many home systems, such as the Commodore 64.

In 1988 the game was reworked by Japanese company Hect to more closely resemble a Zelda-like top-down view (opposed to the original's side-scrolling perspective) and was drastically changed graphically. The goal and general gameplay remain the same, however. This version was released on the NES."

"Shoukoushi Cedie","","Region Not Set","","Fuji Television Network, Inc.","Graphic Research Co., Ltd.","1988-12-24","","No","Adventure","","A NES adventure game based on the anime of the same name, which is an adaptation of Little Lord Fauntleroy.

Shoukoushi Ceddie (sometimes Cedie) is the Japanese title of the 1886 Frances Hodgson Burnett novel Little Lord Fauntleroy, about a down-to-earth kid from New York discovering his heritage as the heir to an Earldom in England, moving to his inherited estate and learning how to become a nobleman. Fuji Television created a 43 episode anime series based on the novel in 1988, and this video game adaptation is based on that TV show. Fuji Television is perhaps best known in western video game circles for being responsible for Doki Doki Panic (the game the American/European Super Mario Bros 2 is based on) as well as airing GameCenter CX (or Retro Game Master).

The game plays much like a regular Famicom adventure game: The player walks around, talks to people and finds items which are used to solve puzzles. However, rather than selecting destinations from a menu, the player manually walks around the different locales using a top-down perspective. There are also action sequences where the player must avoid random pedestrians when leaving the estate. If he collides with an NPC, or goes into the wrong door, he is chided by his tutor and forced to answer trivia questions."

Yes, the flaccid puns start to fly from this point and don't let up until the very end of the game. Those expecting witty dialogue from this game obviously have never spoken to a game programmer before.

It seems that King Kale needs the pair's help to prevent six worlds from being dominated by a mysterious being known as Vegetron. Every hero needs a nemesis, right? Unfortunately, despite managing to look almost evil in a cute way, Vegetron fails to come across as a threat to our heroes. One wonders how he even managed to dominate his back garden, let alone six planets, with his army of cute robots and ""vegetable-themed"" guardian minions, the latter of which are vulnerable in the same spots and which can be dispatched with almost the same pattern on each world. This is the same Vegetron who, after a single defeat at the hands of Maru, realizes the error of his ways and chooses to turn over a new leaf in a platitudinous soliloquy which goes on and on. That puts an end to Veggie's chances of reappearing in sequels without some kind of contrived plot twist.

Our two heroes, then, set off on an adventure to save the kings imprisoned by the boss guardians on each of the six worlds. This being a platform game, each world has its own theme and pitfalls that need to be dealt with. These include the anti-gravity of the Space Fortress, fire pits of the Hot Pepper Planet, black holes of the Star-Spngled [sic] Squash, and requisite icy madness of the Frozen Vegetable Section.

It was never released in North America. Stick Hunter was the first actual ice hockey game created for a Nintendo gaming system.

The game was designed so that 1 player could play against the computer, or 2 players could play simultaneously against each other. The length of the periods and difficulty level could both be adjusted.

Playing as a character who has possession of the puck, the character could not only skate faster, but could only shoot the puck forward. So if the player wanted to pass to a teammate, the character on screen would have to be facing the person to which he's passing. The same applied to shooting at the net and attempting to score a goal. The character would have to be facing the opposing net. A player without the puck could only skate faster. If the goalie had control of the puck, he could only pass to a teammate.

As in the real-world sport of hockey, the object is to score more goals than the opposing team."

The StudyBox itself did not have the standard Play, Stop, Pause, Fast Forward and Rewind buttons on the system, as would be expected with a tape player. Instead, the student (presumably) would use the Famicom controller and on-screen cues to play the tapes.

We don’t exactly know what the tapes would do.

After Namco excited the market for baseball games with the release of Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium, many other companies attempted to meet the demand for more baseball games.

This title differentiated itself from other baseball games by obtaining permission from the Professional Baseball Organization of Japan to use the official names of the 12 Japanese baseball teams and their players. This was a groundbreaking feature at the time. It was also the first game to depict an existing stadium with it's actual name, the Tokyo Dome, which had just opened shortly before the game's release. Outfielder and first baseman Warren Cromartie, formerly with the Montreal Expos, and playing for the Yomiuri Giants at the time, was chosen to help promote the game.

To further distinguish the game, the developers chose to use a more realistic approach when depicting the players on the field, as opposed to the more cartoonish look utilized by Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium and many other baseball games. Additionally, the view remains fairly close to the ball after the batter hits the ball, as opposed to zooming out to a bird's eye view of the field.

"Taro's Quest","","Region Not Set","","Jaleco Ltd.","NMK Co. Ltd.","1989-03-28","","No","Role-Playing","","A ninja-themed RPG by Jaleco for the NES. A US release was planned, but canceled.

Jajamaru Ninpou Chou is part of Jaleco's Ninja Jajamaru-Kun series. Jajamaru-Kun (sometimes spelled JaJaMaru-Kun) is the younger brother of the original Ninja-Kun, who starred in a couple of UPL arcade games known in the west as Ninja-Kid and Ninja-Kid 2. When Jaleco ported the original arcade game to NES, they created the character of Ninja Jajamaru-Kun and continued making games that featured the character. Jajamaru Ninpou Chou is his third Famicom game.

However, unlike the two previous Ninja Jajamaru-Kun games, which were action platformers, Ninpou Chou is a traditional JRPG. The player walks around a world map visiting towns and dungeons and occasionally fighting random encounters using a separate turn-based combat screen.

Worth noting is that this game was slated for a 1990 US release with the name Taro's Quest, though it was later canceled. However, an incomplete prototype version of the ROM exists. As well as an English localization, the game appeared to have had its graphics almost entirely redrawn in order to appear more realistic than the cartoonish original."

- Updated player ratings
- Rosters updated for the 1990 season - Players like Eric Dickerson, Michael Dean Perry, and Brent Williams are now included
- Updated playbooks - No more reverses! (New plays added to v4.0!)

Fortunately you don't have to face these freaks of torture alone.

Mito Koumon is a long-running Japanese TV show that follows the elderly Tokugawa Mitsukuni, legendary law-maker and former daimyo of the Mito region, and his two retainers Sasaki Sukesabur? and Atsumi Kakunoshin as they enter towns incognito and solve problems regarding political corruption, crime bosses and other problems plaguing the common folk. Only after solving the problem would Tokugawa reveal his identity. He and his retainers would then move on.

The game is an adaptation of the TV show, allowing players to assume the role of one of the retainers as they go around investigating the town. Occasionally this involves fights with corrupt officials, evil samurai and gangsters. There's also a female ghost that will drain the player character's life if it comes into contact with them.

The game is noted for its many instances of speech samples. It also has a considerable amount of text.

Players move around towns from a top-down perspective, going left or right as well as up and down. They can fight other characters on the screen (not all of which are hostile) as well as enter houses and stores to talk to NPCs or purchase items from them. The goal is to hunt down clues to ascertain what problems are plaguing the town, then go fix them."

A random sequence of tetrominoes (sometimes called ""tetrads"" in older versions)—shapes composed of four square blocks each—fall down the playing field (a rectangular vertical shaft, called the ""well"" or ""matrix""). The objective of the game is to manipulate these tetrominoes, by moving each one sideways and rotating it by 90 degree units, with the aim of creating a horizontal line of blocks without gaps. When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block above the deleted line will fall. With every ten lines that are cleared, the game enters a new level. As the game progresses, each level causes the tetrominoes to fall faster, and the game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the playing field and no new tetrominoes are able to enter. In certain versions, the game can also end if the player is able to get all the way to level 15.

All of the tetrominoes are capable of single and double clears. I, J, and L are able to clear triples. Only the I tetromino has the capacity to clear four lines simultaneously, and this is referred to as a ""tetris"". (This may vary depending on the rotation and compensation rules of each specific Tetris implementation. For instance, in the Super Rotation System used in most recent implementations, called ""Easy Spin"" in Tetris Worlds, certain rare situations allow T, S and Z to 'snap' into tight spots and clear triples.)"

Meanwhile, the company worked rapidly behind the scenes to override Nintendo's infamous lockout device that kept unofficial cartridges from being played on its console. When Tengen released its first unofficial games using its new technology, Nintendo quickly sued. This was just the beginning of the Tengen/Nintendo feud. Ignoring Nintendo's claim to the Tetris name in the US a year later, Tengen released its own version of the world's most famous puzzle game on an unlocked, unofficial cartridge. Tengen's tetris was pulled from shelves almost immediately when it was revealed that Nintendo's hold on the Tetris name stateside was legitimate. Unfortunately, almost everyone agrees that Tengen's version of the game was far superior to Nintendo's, even including a two-player mode which Nintendo's version sorely lacked.

The game was followed by a sequel that diverges from the movie's story and is better known to US audiences. The game is not to be confused with the 1985 Datasoft game for the C64, Atari 8-Bit and Spectrum which was closer to The Lost Vikings with its co-operative puzzles.

Gameplay:
The game features Mikey as he runs around various stages based on locations from the movie - the closed restaurant that the Fratellis use as a hideout, the caverns beneath the restaurant and One-Eyed Willy's pirate ship - saving his friends and recovering keys. In order to progress, Mikey must find three keys and the captive Goonie on each stage. As well as bats, rats and other hostile wildlife, Mikey is being pursued by the three Fratelli family members: they cannot be defeated, but can be stunned temporarily.

Mikey can find power-ups that help him proceed. The most important of these are bombs which destroy walls marked by skulls and reveal keys and captive Goonies behind them. Permanent bonuses like headphones (which prevents Mikey being hurt by Jake Fratelli's opera singing) and a backpack (which allows Mikey to carry two bombs at once) can also be found, but only once and each in a specific stage."

"The Legend of Iowa","","Other","","Romhacking","?","2015-04-20","1","No","Action | Adventure | Unofficial","Not Rated","This is the debut release of The Legend of Iowa, a complete rewrite of “The Legend of Zelda”.

Since the nature of this game is one of secrets & exploration, there are bound to be instances where you just don’t know what to do or where to go next. Again, feel free to contact me with questions.

This game was designed with the original Zelda in mind, so fans of that game should know what to expect. Difficulty was toned down (particularly that of the early Second Quest) pursuant to the feedback of several Beta Testers; this hack is on-par with or slightly easier than the original game.

This hack is intended to capture the original sense of immersion found in the early Zelda games. Fans of the original will know once they get involved in the game: epic exploration, multiple routes, cryptic hints and scores of secrets. Despite playing like a Zelda game, it establishes its own identity. To wit:

- The entire Soundtrack has been replaced. And in most cases, with 8-bit renditions of vintage techno/dance/rave classics!
- The Overworld is completely new. Graphics, layouts, animation, screen-specific Attribute Patterns and etc!
- 18 New Dungeons. Or more accurately: 18 Meth Labs, nine per quest. Don’t expect the same old tricks to work, either. The secret pushblock isn’t always going to be leftmost-center. (Possibly never!)
- New Dungeon Elements. In addition to the new graphics, layouts, animations and Attribute Patterns, you’ll be dealing with new room secrets and enemy combinations.

The doors are open, but you still need to find that pushblock to make a critical item appear! But first, you’ll need to kill that small army of Darknuts & Wizzrobes…

- Work for Life. The number of complete heart containers has been reduced from 13 to 1. If you want to expand your lifebar, you’ll have to seek out the 48 heart pieces!
- WAY More Bombs! They aren’t exactly bombs in this hack, but they explode just the same. And if you play your cards right, you’ll max-out your carrying capacity at 255!

- Stopwatch as an Item. Again, it isn’t exactly a Stopwatch (nor is it easy to acquire), but you’ll eventually have a form of portable invincibility to use against That One Boss™.
- New storyline, characters & enemy designs. Farmer Bob even grunts differently!"

The Money Game is a stock market simulation game where the goal is to raise money through the wise purchasing and selling of various types of stock. Coupled to this is a life-sim aspect where raising a sufficient amount of money at certain checkpoints allows the player to gain and keep a girlfriend, who later becomes their wife and provides children. As well, the player can upgrade from their initial studio apartment to a terraced house to a mansion with its own Olympic-sized swimming pool.

The game is densely packed with Japanese script and requires both literacy in that language and a fairly good understanding of dealing in the stock market itself (though the game does provide tutorials for the latter). It would be followed by a sequel, The Money Game 2: Kabutochou no Kiseki, which in turn would be the basis for SOFEL's Wall Street Kid."

"The Quest of Ki","Kai no Bouken","Region Not Set","","Namco","Game Studio","1988-07-22","1","No","Platform","Not Rated","The Quest of Ki (カイの冒険 Kai no Bōken?) is a 1988 video game developed by Game Studio and published by Namco for the Family Computer. It is the third game in Babylonian Castle Saga series which started with the 1984 arcade game, The Tower of Druaga.

The story of The Quest of Ki is actually a prequel to the original Tower of Druaga. It occurs shortly after the demon Druaga has stolen the Blue Crystal Rod and taken it to his tower. The goddess Ishtar sends the priestess Ki to the tower in order to retrieve it. The game then follows her doomed quest to the top of the tower, and leads directly into the story of the original game.

The game is a side-scrolling platformer with one hundred levels. In each level, the player's goal is to pick up a key and open the door leading to the next area. Various enemies, including slimes, ghosts, and wizards, appear on each floor, and any contact with them results in death.

Ki has no weapons, and thus can not damage or defeat any of the enemies. Her only abilities are to dash and jump. As long as the player holds the jump button down, Ki can rise indefinitely into the air. However, contact with the ceiling will cause her to drop to the ground and become stunned for several seconds.

Many of the levels consist of puzzles in which the player must carefully regulate the height and direction of Ki's jumps. Each stage in the game contains one or more treasure chest, which hold various items. Although many of the items bestow helpful abilities, the effects only last for the floor on which they were found.

After completing the game, players can gain access to forty bonus stages. These stages contain cameos from the Pac-Man ghosts and the enemies from Dig Dug."

Several features that weren't present in any other fighting games on Famicom were included: a 'rage' gauge that may be refilled by holding BW+A and performing a super move when it's fully charged; three-tiered health bar; and, finally, the 'conquest' mode, where you have to eliminate all of your opponent's fortresses in order to win.

The game has six playable characters, with every of them selectable from the beginning (from left to right): Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Huang Zhong, Cao Ren, Mei Hu, and Lu Bu. However, during the 'conquest' mode, there are two more characters that are not playable the regular way: Shi Ren and Xie Seng. Both of them are slightly overpowered but have only two tiers of health at the very beginning.

In the 'arcade' mode, the player should defeat all six opponents (including his clone) in a specified order. Only nine continues are available for this type of game.

'Conquest' mode, in its' turn, proposes the player to choose one of two preset teams, with each having three characters. After the choice is done, the player has to decide which enemy's fortress he should siege. Once the fortress is selected, the attacker's staying on his own, while the defending side has Shi Ren, Xie Seng and the actual ""defender"" (stage ""owner"") appearing in the same defined order, King of Fighters style. Should only the attacker defeat one of the opponents, his health's being fully restored. Once all three opponent's fortresses fall, the player wins."

The game is the first in the Babylonian Castle Saga and second chronologically. In 1992, the game was remade for the PC Engine which saw numerous changes detailed below.

Combining hack & slash real-time combat with some basic RPG elements, it laid the foundations for early action role-playing games such as Dragon Slayer and Hydlide. Its hack & slash combat included the ability to both attack with a sword by pressing the attack button and defend with a shield by standing still. It attracted millions of fans in Japan and went on to inspire early action RPGs such as Dragon Slayer, Hydlide, Ys and The Legend of Zelda. The game also debuted the Slime monsters which would later become the mascot of the Dragon Quest series.

The game served the basis of an anime series, The Tower of Druaga: The Aegis of Uruk, from studio Gonzo and was broadcast between April 2008 to March 2009. The anime takes place 60 years after the events of the game. A noteworthy element of the anime is the music, composed by famed video game composer Hitoshi Sakimoto."

"Tsuppari Wars","","Region Not Set","","Sammy Corporation","Sammy Studios","1991-06-28","3","No","Action","","Tsuppari Wars ( つっぱりウォーズ?, ""Delinquent Wars"") is an action video game for the Family Computer. The object is to acquire all of the enemies' territory and defeat the evil gang leaders. Even though this game was only released in Japan, the gangsters fight without any weapons and the violence level is mild compared to later gang-related games. Its spiritual descendant is Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas due to its simulation of gang warfare.

Once the main gang leader is defeated in either Tsuppari Wars (ツッパリウォーズ?) or Tsuppari Suku (ツッパリスク?) mode, the remaining members of the gang switch membership to become a gray-colored gang that does not have a leader. Consequently, all territory that belonged to leader that was killed in combat becomes neutral territory with a number describing the strength of the ""neutral gangs."" These ""neutral gangs"" will attempt to defend their turf. In order for a gang with colors (red, blue, or green) to use the land as their own, they must eliminate all the gangsters in that territory. However, invasions can be canceled before they can begin by saying ""no"" when asked to fight (たたかい?, ""Struggle"").

Neutral gangs, fortunately, do not have ability to invade the territories of the red, blue, or green colored gangs. There are three difficulty levels for computer opponents and games are possible with two or three colors (but never with only one color). After naming the character (using the Japanese alphabet), the player must select his face that will represent his main gang leader. The two gang leaders involved will use a special fighting game engine to settle their differences while individual gang members will fight each other through a special battle screen. The battle screen allows players to use special effects against the opponent like a motorcycle, a thunderstorm, or even a quick call to the police's riot squad. All brawls are timed by a timer which is never seen in the game.

That means if there is no determined winner in a certain number of time, the brawl ends with a stalemate and no territory gains or losses are made. The brawl can be re-initiated either during the player's next turn or during the opponent's turn. There are eight different maps to choose from that depict the world in a manner similar to the board game Risk. There are islands with land bridges and bodies of water to them. Between combat, the player can either move (いどうし?, ""Not among"") his gang members from territory to territory or immediately end his turn. It is possible for a player to transfer all of his gang members out of a territory, turning it into a blank grey territory without a number."
"Tsuri Kichi Sanpei: Blue Marlin Hen","","Region Not Set","","Victor Interactive Software, Inc.","","1988-03-17","","No","Sports","","A fishing sim based on a manga license for the NES. It was developed by Victor Interactive and never released outside of Japan.

Tsurikichi Sanpei: Blue Marlin Hen (lit: ""Fishing Maniac Sanpei: Blue Marlin Chapter"") is a fishing sim based on a manga and eventual anime named Tsurikichi Sanpei, following the adventures of a preternaturally gifted young fisherman and his travails in various fishing competitions.

The game is centered around one of these fishing competitions, where Sanpei has a limited amount of time to catch the largest blue marlin out of all the competitors. The player must make careful judgements and use their limited time wisely to find and hook the largest marlin they can before the competition ends.

The first game based on the Tsurikichi Sanpei license, Blue Marlin Hen was released on the NES and the MSX around the same time in 1988. Later, there would be a sequel of sorts for the MSX only in 1989 and a PS1 game much later in 2002.

In order to catch anything, the player must choose one of several regions of sea in which to fish. Areas which look promising have large fish icons. Time passes more quickly on this screen, so it's in the player's best interest to find a spot quickly.

Once a sea region has been selected, the player must choose the right kind of bait for hooking billfish and simply sit until they have a bite. At this point, the player must use the gauge above the screen to maneuver themselves and reel the fish on the line. Each fish is judged on its size and play resumes."

Moreover, the game lacks the 3-Player mode from Moero, allowing only up to two players. The game is considerably easier than its predecessors due to an option mode that allows players to adjust the difficulty and number of ships, as well as the inclusion of the new ""soul reviving system"", which allows players to recover their power-ups after losing a ship.

The game uses digitized PCM voice samples, particularly when the conga music in one stage chants ""Poko Poko"", and in the beginning of each stage, in which a voice proclaims the name of the stage."

Each level takes place on a playfield divided into an invisible grid, each space of which can contain one object.

Is an action game released in 1985 that was developed and published by Nintendo. It was designed by Yoshio Sakamoto and was released as a launch title for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

The player controls Mario (or Luigi, in multiplayer mode) and his objective is to destroy a whole series of objects with a hammer in each of the 100 levels of the game. Mario cannot jump due to the weight of the hammer. The player can select any level from the home screen. Each level takes place in a space divided by an invisible grid, of which each space can have some object. The game also introduced a new character, a construction manager named Spike (believed to be an early version of Wario), who chases after Mario and tries to disrupt him by throwing objects at him to try to make him fall towards the back of the stage. The player starts with 5 life and loses one when Mario makes contact with an enemy or a fireball. The game is over when Mario loses all of his lives.

Since Mario cannot jump, the player must think carefully about the order in which he destroys the objects. For example, if a player destroys a ladder too early, a wall may become unreachable and therefore the player will not be able to complete the level. Destroying multiple items in a row (usually with a chain of bombs) can score extra points, and occasionally items may appear as bonuses.

The game also has a level editor, which allows the player to design 4 levels. However, the level loading and saving features were designed for use with the Famicom Data Recorder, a cassette-type device that was released only in Japan, making the ability to save and load levels impossible for North American users (however, the American manual includes a note mentioning that these functions ""have been programmed for the development of potential products""). When the game was released as a virtual console in North America, the save and load features were re-enabled using system memory, but the Nintendo 3DS version cannot use those features"

He destroys his enemies by firing small Ki bullets, which can be charged to increase their power; however, if overcharged, he is left unable to move or fight for a few seconds. During boss battles, Tarosuke kneels at a shrine to Buddha and prays, summoning ""Monmotaro"" (not to be confused with ""Momotar?""), a spirit which floats in the air and drops energy balls on the boss and any lackeys he has.

"Yousei Monogatari Rod Land","Rod Land","Region Not Set","","Jaleco Ltd.","Jaleco Ltd.","1992-12-11","2","Yes","Action | Puzzle","","The player(s) control one or two fairies called Tam and Rit armed with a magic wand (rod). Following the concept of Taito's Bubble Bobble, the rod doesn't kill the monsters directly, but only leaves them immobilized, crying. To kill them, the rod can grasp them in a magic force-field and the player can smash them down over her head until they disappear and leave a power-up behind.

Each level is only one small screen composed of monsters, platforms, ladders and, later, tunnels. Unlike other games of the genre, the players can never jump, but have to use ladders. They can conjure one custom ladder above or below them in order to go to the appropriate platform. There can be only one such 'custom' ladder; therefore if the fairy summons it again, it will disappear from its previous position in order to appear again next to the fairy. This can be beneficial for the player, if a monster is climbing that ladder to approach her.

The fairies' quest is to rescue their mother, trapped in a tower. In the sequel (part of the original arcade machine) they must venture into a pyramid, to stop an evil force that is building a mobile fortress. The spirit of their departed father ""guides"" them at a couple of points. The ending implies that the evil in the pyramid was somehow responsible for their father's death."

Very rarely, for some strange reason, one of the eggs produces a red demon with a big hairdo instead of the expected gray and wrinkled baby bird. This is how Yun came to life. It was already late, almost dusk, so she couldn’t see very well. As demons are usually born incredibly hungry, she began eating what she found – and one of such things was a toothpaste tube somebody had left among the bushes. Such an accident, nevertheless, proved being really useful, as Yun gained the ability to produce bubbles from her mouth, and she soon learned how to capture all kinds of animals in them. Just a few months on, she founded her very own Japanese food restaurant by the marsh.

With her incredible ability, she could trap even the rarest specimen of fish and made the finest sushi in Badajoz. Everything was going great, until one night where, while hunting in the dark waters, she was about to trap a big and shiny orange fugu fish as it appeared from behind a bunch of seaweeds. The fish looked her in the eye and it was love at the first sight. Sadly, the fugu knew about Yun’s activities and got the chills so it escaped.

Yun, make up for all the damage done, decided to change the nature of her business: instead of serving raw fish to the customers, he’d server raw customers to the fish."
