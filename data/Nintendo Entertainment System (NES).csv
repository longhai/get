Snowland, who lost the princess who controls the magic of snow, begins to melt little by little. At this rate, the kingdom will soon disappear! Nick and Tom, the snowmen, felt unprecedented resentment at being robbed of the princesses in front of them. They vowed to rescue the princesses from the hands of the villains, and set out for the kingdom of Hotda, where the enemy was waiting.

The home of the enemy, Hotda Castle, is a 70-store stone tower. A fire-breathing monster is roaming, and Atchich is worried about the fire and built the castle out of stone. It's more like a fortress than a castle because it's durable first, so it's not a very elegant castle. The snowmen, who are not good at hot places, tried to infiltrate the hot castle of Atchich with courage."

The player does not select plays for either offense or defense. On offense, the player simply receives the ball upon the snap and either attempt to run with the quarterback, toss the ball to one of two running backs, or throw the ball to the one long distance receiver - basically the option offense. On defense, the player chooses one of two players to control, and the computer manipulates the others. The ball can also be punted or a field goal can be attempted."
"10-Yard Fight [5 Screw]","","Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","NTSC","United States of America","Nintendo of America, Inc.","Irem Corp.","1985-10-01","1","No","Sports","Not Rated","The main idea of this game is that players take control of a football team and have the task of trying to score a touchdown before the clock runs out.

Players start out as a high school team. Games consist of two halves. One touchdown must be scored before time runs out in each half or the game is lost. After a touchdown is scored, the half ends and the 2nd half of the game starts. If the player scores in both halves, they win the game and then move on to the next level of difficulty. Difficulty levels after high school go from college, pro, then to super. The higher the difficulty, the less amount of time is given for a player to score a touchdown.

Since the game is concerned with scoring touchdowns, in the 1 player game the player is always on offense. Players can score points for completing passes and for gaining yards by either rushing or passing. Scoring a touchdown also adds to the player's score, as does any remaining time on the clock after the touchdown is scored. Also after a touchdown, the player can add on to their score by kicking an extra point.

Other rules on the field include getting a 1st down to add time to the clock. If the player throws an interception or goes four downs without getting a 1st down, they are penalized yards.

In a 2 player game, the second player plays defense until it's their turn to play offense."

Był to solidny kartridż którego obudowa była gruba i twarda, zaś płytka PCB zapełniona po brzegi układami scalonymi. Producenci widać starali się by kartridż był wykonany w wysokiej jakości i przyciągał ludzi do kupna konsol oferując na jednej kasecie dużą ilość gier w cenie jednej; w niektórych rejonach zapewne kaseta reklamowała Pegsusa tak jak Tekken reklamował PSXa. Obudowa na początku była w przyjaznym dla oka kolorze fioletowym, później pojawiały się reedycje kartridża, różniących się kolorem i kształtem obudowy a z czasem także pojawiła się podróbka ''168 in 1'' do której dodano parę innych gier. Na labelu były miniaturki okładek wybranych gier, które między innymi znajdowały się na karcie. Nad obrazkami widniał napis ''168 in 1'' a obok napis ''high quality'' o czym wspomniałem wcześniej, producenci kartridża zapewniali nas o wysokiej jakości już na labelu a także go reklamowali grą Contra, która była pożądana w tamtych czasach i była najbardziej popularną grą zaraz obok Super Mario Bros (napis Contra widniał na labelu a także po uruchomieniu konsoli ze 168 in 1 witało nas duże logo CONTRA z Bóg wie czemu przygrywającą muzyczką z gry Booby Kids, niemniej bardzo ona pasowała i nie drażniła uszu). Kartridż miał także label z tyłu obudowy, na którym widniał mikroskopijnym drukiem cały spis gier jakie zawierała składanka; później takie labele pojawiały się na innych składankach, które zawierały kilkadziesiąt gier i więcej, był to niewątpliwie wielki plus dla graczy gdyż mogli sprawdzić jakie gry zawierają składanki bez kupowania ich w ciemno."

Size-optimized ports of Artemio's 240p Test Suite to 8-bit consoles

I've remade Artemio Urbina's 240p Test Suite for three more platforms:

    Nintendo Entertainment System
    Game Boy and Game Boy Color (as ""144p Test Suite"")
    Game Boy Advance (as ""160p Test Suite"")

The NES and GB ports are in assembly language for speed and size efficiency. The GBA port is in C, but still size-optimized to fit well within the 256 KiB multiboot limit.

The GB and GBA ports have a different name because their LCD video timing doesn't match that of NTSC. They exist to test not only the TV but also the Super Game Boy or Game Boy Player accessory, which behaves as a scaler.

Some functionality has been rearranged to fit the controller or to combine the function of similar tests. Some help pages have been rewritten for completeness, conciseness, and English usage improvements. Some tests' graphics have been replaced to keep the software free.

To get set up to build the NES port, install GNU Make, Coreutils, Python 3, Pillow, and cc65 per nrom-template instructions. The port to Game Boy uses RGBDS instead of cc65. The GBA port uses devkitARM and libgba by devkitPro, but Python 3 and Pillow are still required to convert the proportional font.

Like Artemio's original versions, these ports of 240p Test Suite are free software under the GNU General Public License, version 2 or later.

Do you like the pegboard game? Do you like !CLIK!? What if they were also two-player competitive on the NES? Well then this game's for you! Compete against a friend, or play witchoself (get those tissues, though)! There are 3 different 2-player games, along with a bonus 2-player game that you can unlock after beating all the games as 1-player. If you look around, you might also find ANOTHER 2-player only game that is hidden within! The entire reason I started programming this game was to try and kind of vindicate myself in some way. I had already done some other games that were bigger in scope than the games of Tic-Tac XO, Pegs and !CLIK!, but didn't like how I had coded them due to being newer using 6502 at the time. All you have to do is look at the sources for those games to understand what I'm talking about! So, I went about putting the basic elements of those games into one cart, but just more standard (for instance, just regular Tic-Tac-Toe), and for 1 or 2 players. With that said, there is some sort of glitching that happens to the PPU during Tic-Tac-Toe that I could never track down, but ah well. It was a neat project. Snail Trail, one of the bonus games, was an idea for a parody of the Tron cycles game. Originally I was going to have the snails move UUUUU-BER slow. I think it turned out better having them move at the speed they are, though."

"3D Block","","Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)","Region Not Set","","","Hwang Shinwei","1989-01-01","1","No","Puzzle","Not Rated","3D Block is a pirated port of Blockout, made for the Famicom by Hwang Shinwei in 1989. There are three versions: a 1989 version credited to Hwang Shinwei and a 1990 version credited to ""RCM Group"" with a slightly different title screen. A 1991 version exists on some multicarts and credits both.

This is an adaptation of Blockout, which in itself is a 3D version of Tetris. This is emphasized with the cartridge itself, having the artwork ripped from the original game. In this version the well is 5x5x10 cubes large and the size never changes, unlike the official versions. The controls are somewhat unorthodox, as unlike most other games, the Select button pauses the game while Start speeds up the block so that it moves to the bottom of the well faster. The block designs themselves are the same as in the arcade version of Blockout.

There are 20 levels in total, with the player being able to start on any of the first 9, and the speed of the game can be set like in Tetris. Normally, you can select only the first 10 levels, but by pressing A, B, Up, then Down on Controller 1, then pressing A to increase the level number counter, you can select levels 11-20 as well. The levels increase in speed as they progress and on most of the levels there are blocks which are in full 3D as opposed to standard Tetris blocks. On each level, 4 layers have to be cleared to advance. Clearing all of the blocks on the screen automatically ends the level. After completing level 20, the game reverts back to the title screen where the shape in the middle changes color to reveal a nude, poorly digitized woman wearing high heels. This same effect can be found by pressing A, B, Up, then Down on Controller 1, then pressing Select 10 times on the title screen.

The graphics are mostly taken from Blockout, apart from the title screen and menu, which are original. When the blocks are stacked up in this version, they appear to be layers of squares. The music, however, is the same music heard in Hwang Shinwei's other games."

There are very few differences between the two games. The most notable difference is the title screen, which is completely changed. The only parts that remain from the original title screen are the blue background, the salmon font color of the game title, a flashing white text saying ""PUSH START BUTTON !"", and a picture of Fred Flintstone in a gold star (which was originally a part of the Hanna Barbera Super Stars logo). The title screen music, a remix of ""Meet the Flintstones"", stays the same as well. The rest is completely changed. The title and logo are replaced with a large salmon ""7"", a picture of a bootleg Mario recolor (later nicknamed Grand Dad) with the character's head overlaid by the Fred Flintstone star, and a salmon ""GRAND DAD"" in a curious square-ish font. The credits at the bottom of the screen are replaced with white text saying ""1992 1"". The ""1"", commonly mistaken to be a bootlegger's nickname, is in fact a level select which can be used by pressing the ""Select"" button, which causes the number to go up (until 5).[3][4] This level select was implemented by the bootleggers and wasn't featured in the original game.

During gameplay, the head of Fred Flintstone's sprite is replaced with the head of Super Mario from Super Mario Bros. 3. However, during cutscenes and the basketball minigame, Fred appears unedited, and he is always called by his real name. Finally, the ending credits are altered to say, ""PRESENTED BY XXXXX"" instead of ""PRESENTED BY TAITO"". The rest of the final credits are unchanged.

The game was originally distributed in its own bootleg cart, under the title 原始瑪莉[note 1] VII (GRAND DAD 3M). Later, it was included in a Russian Mario 7-in-1 Dendy multicart, as 7. MARIO 7."

After hundreds of years of chaos, mankind has finally emerged from the ruins of nuclear war. This world of the distant future has once again fluorished under the guidance of the Great King, who harnessed the power of the 8 Eyes to rebuild the planet.

These strange jewels of power were formed at the eyes, or centers, of the eight nuclear explosions which nearly destroyed the Earth. In the wrong hands, the 8 Eyes could cause untold destruction...And now, they have been seized by the Great King's eight Dukes, in a desperate bid to gain control of the world for themselves. They have banished the King to the nuclear wastelands, and already their squabbling threatens to plunge the world into war once again!

The task of retrieving the 8 Eyes falls to you, Orin the Falconer, the bravest and mightiest of the King's Guardsmen. With your fighting falcon, Cutrus, you must penetrate each of the eight Dukes' castles. There you will face the Dukes' soldiers, and battle strange nuclear mutants such as living skeletons, giant wasps, and mud men. You must defeat the monstrous Boss of each castle to retrieve the Jewel of Power he guards.

Then, to complete your quest, return the 8 Eyes to the Altar of Peace to await the return on the Great King, so that he may finish the rebuilding of Earth. Your reward will be the the eternal gratitude of all mankind!"
