"Snow Bros.","Snow Bros.: Nick & Tom","1990-04-01","NTSC-J","Japan","Toaplan Co., Ltd.","Toaplan Co., Ltd.","2","Yes","Not Rated","Platform","Burning with the ambition of world domination, King Atchich of the Kingdom of Hotda abducted the two beautiful princesses of Snowland as the beginning of the invasion and imprisoned them deep inside the castle of the Kingdom of Hotda. Snowland, who lost the princess who controls the magic of snow, begins to melt little by little. At this rate, the kingdom will soon disappear! Nick and Tom, the snowmen, felt unprecedented resentment at being robbed of the princesses in front of them. They vowed to rescue the princesses from the hands of the villains, and set out for the kingdom of Hotda, where the enemy was waiting. The home of the enemy, Hotda Castle, is a 70-store stone tower. A fire-breathing monster is roaming, and Atchich is worried about the fire and built the castle out of stone. It's more like a fortress than a castle because it's durable first, so it's not a very elegant castle. The snowmen, who are not good at hot places, tried to infiltrate the hot castle of Atchich with courage."

They still exist today, but they tend to be extended to more interactive dating sims rather than just walls of text to read. This game being released in December 1988 and namely so, it was designed to predict your fortune for the upcoming year 1989. This makes attempting to play it already kind of useless once the year had passed. Therefore one can only look back at what the computer predicted for you back in 1989."
"[Welcome To] Eville","Welcome To Eville","2013-03-01","NTSC-U","United States of America","KHAN Games","","1","No","Not Rated","Music","The echos from previous albums decay into chaos as the opening dystopic collapse of [Welcome to] Eville escorts the listener through a celebration of evil. No heros have arrived to restore order, no last-ditch-efforts planned, no small-town nobodies with nothing to lose are out killing honest working henchmen and well-meaning mini-bosses. Eville is an audible commemoration to the iron-fist rule of the Boss, of a simpler time when villagers knew their place and no one had the guts to stand up and fight. Eville was made with the Famitracker and uses only the original NES chipset."

"10-Yard Fight","10ヤードファイト","1985-10-18","NTSC","United States of America","Irem Corp.","Nintendo","2","No","E - Everyone","Sports","The game is viewed in a top-down perspective and is vertical scrolling. The player does not select plays for either offense or defense. On offense, the player simply receives the ball upon the snap and either attempt to run with the quarterback, toss the ball to one of two running backs, or throw the ball to the one long distance receiver - basically the option offense. On defense, the player chooses one of two players to control, and the computer manipulates the others. The ball can also be punted or a field goal can be attempted."
"10-Yard Fight [5 Screw]","","1985-10-01","NTSC","United States of America","Irem Corp.","Nintendo of America, Inc.","1","No","Not Rated","Sports","The main idea of this game is that players take control of a football team and have the task of trying to score a touchdown before the clock runs out. Players start out as a high school team. Games consist of two halves. One touchdown must be scored before time runs out in each half or the game is lost. After a touchdown is scored, the half ends and the 2nd half of the game starts. If the player scores in both halves, they win the game and then move on to the next level of difficulty. Difficulty levels after high school go from college, pro, then to super. The higher the difficulty, the less amount of time is given for a player to score a touchdown. Since the game is concerned with scoring touchdowns, in the 1 player game the player is always on offense. Players can score points for completing passes and for gaining yards by either rushing or passing. Scoring a touchdown also adds to the player's score, as does any remaining time on the clock after the touchdown is scored. Also after a touchdown, the player can add on to their score by kicking an extra point. Other rules on the field include getting a 1st down to add time to the clock. If the player throws an interception or goes four downs without getting a 1st down, they are penalized yards. In a 2 player game, the second player plays defense until it's their turn to play offense."

"168 in 1","","1970-01-01","Other","United States of America","","","2","Yes","E - Everyone","Unofficial","Każdy kto miał w domu Pegasusa na początku lat 90 nawet dzisiaj zapytany odpowie bez namysłu, że ''168 in 1'' był najbardziej popularny w szeregu innych kartridżów. Składanka była dodawana najczęściej do kompletu z konsolą MT-777DX a z czasem można było ją dostać w sklepach elektronicznych a także na bazarach. Był to solidny kartridż którego obudowa była gruba i twarda, zaś płytka PCB zapełniona po brzegi układami scalonymi. Producenci widać starali się by kartridż był wykonany w wysokiej jakości i przyciągał ludzi do kupna konsol oferując na jednej kasecie dużą ilość gier w cenie jednej; w niektórych rejonach zapewne kaseta reklamowała Pegsusa tak jak Tekken reklamował PSXa. Obudowa na początku była w przyjaznym dla oka kolorze fioletowym, później pojawiały się reedycje kartridża, różniących się kolorem i kształtem obudowy a z czasem także pojawiła się podróbka ''168 in 1'' do której dodano parę innych gier. Na labelu były miniaturki okładek wybranych gier, które między innymi znajdowały się na karcie. Nad obrazkami widniał napis ''168 in 1'' a obok napis ''high quality'' o czym wspomniałem wcześniej, producenci kartridża zapewniali nas o wysokiej jakości już na labelu a także go reklamowali grą Contra, która była pożądana w tamtych czasach i była najbardziej popularną grą zaraz obok Super Mario Bros (napis Contra widniał na labelu a także po uruchomieniu konsoli ze 168 in 1 witało nas duże logo CONTRA z Bóg wie czemu przygrywającą muzyczką z gry Booby Kids, niemniej bardzo ona pasowała i nie drażniła uszu). Kartridż miał także label z tyłu obudowy, na którym widniał mikroskopijnym drukiem cały spis gier jakie zawierała składanka; później takie labele pojawiały się na innych składankach, które zawierały kilkadziesiąt gier i więcej, był to niewątpliwie wielki plus dla graczy gdyż mogli sprawdzić jakie gry zawierają składanki bez kupowania ich w ciemno."
