"Makeruna! Makendō Z","Makeruna! Makendou Z","NTSC-J","","NEC Home Electronics, Ltd.","Fill In Cafe | 																Sugeiya","1998-03-20","1","No","Role-Playing","Not Rated","Makeruna! Makendō Z takes place in the same universe as Makeruna! Makendō, known outside of Japan as Kendo Rage. However, unlike the first game (or its sequel), this is a Japanese-style RPG. Like the other Makeruna! Makendō games (the name means Don't lose, magic kendo!), it has comedy elements. The story takes place in a high school attended by two sisters, Hikari and Mai. Their cousin Saya just came back to Japan from the USA, where she was sent as an exchange student. Due to an unfortunate experiment, the gate to the demon world opens in the school. Using their magic kendo powers, the girls have to find portals to the demon world, defeat the demons, and restore peace in the school.

Makeruna! Makendō Z plays like a traditional Japanese RPG, with top-down navigation and random turn-based battles viewed from first-person perspective. The gameplay system is simplified even compared to other Japanese RPGs: game progression is strictly linear, and the girls cannot equip anything. They have, however, access to magic spells and various kendo techniques.

The game features anime-style movies and still shots. Every kendo technique, for example, is displayed as a full-screen anime-style picture."

Instead of anime-style portraits of school girls, there are pictures (and a few full motion videos) of real Japanese young women. Gameplay follows the same formula as the other graduation games: as a high school teacher, the player's task is to successfully lead five high school girls to their graduation. Most of the activities consist of making schedules, organizing classes, and giving assignments to the girls. It is necessary to know the strength and the weaknesses of each girl, in order to choose correct activities. The teacher supervises not only everything the girls do in the school, but also some of their activities during leisure time, including making plans for the holidays."

Ryō-ōki FX includes Tenchi Muyō! Ryō-ōki with slightly better graphics (full-screen pictures instead of framed ones), and a whole new chapter, which is dedicated to officers of the Galaxy Police. The new chapter centers around the green-haired Hakua, who works for Mihoshi Kuramitsu, one of the game's main characters, and Detective Kiyone Makibi, Mihoshi's ex-partner."
"Wakusei Kōgekitai: Little Cats","Wakusei Kougekitai: Little Cats","NTSC-J","","NEC Home Electronics, Ltd.","Family Soft","1997-07-04","1","No","Strategy","Not Rated","The galaxy is threatened by robotic enemies from a remote space. In order to stop them, giant combat robots were deployed to a space station under the command of Colonel Goofy Reagan. The combat robots are navigated by the best pilots, which happen to be cute teenage girls. Since the Colonel is very busy, he needs somebody to watch over the girls and train them. This somebody would be Major David Lowe, the protagonist of the game...

Little Cats is somewhat similar to Sakura Taisen games, with adventure and dating elements reduced, and simulation elements added. David has to make schedules for the girls and decide how much and what exactly they should train. Running competitions, shooting range, robot navigation - everything can be trained, but at the expense of the girls' stamina, which means they will need to rest as well. During the simulation mode, it is also possible to wander around the space station and spend time with the girls.

The strategy part consists of navigating the robots over a battle field in turn-based fashion. The robots have a wide range of attacks, and it is possible to change their weapons and use items in combat. Once the robots attack each other, an automatic attack sequence is shown."
"Aa! Megami-sama!","","NTSC-J","","NEC Home Electronics, Ltd.","HuneX","1997-12-12","1","No","Adventure","Not Rated","The game is a remake of the computer game of the same name. It adds an animated intro, voice-overs, and two mini-games.

The story is based on the manga/anime series Ah! My Goddess, depicting the adventures of Keiichi, a Japanese teenager who accidentally summoned the Norse goddess Verdandi (misspelled ""Belldandy"" in the romanization) and made a wish for her to stay with him forever, which led to all kinds of troubles. What's more, other powerful beings out there are seeking to harm Keiichi's divine girlfriend, so a simple date ends in an unexpected way...

The game is a ""digital comic"", meaning that the adventure elements are reduced to the bare minimum: being able to choose dialogue lines or make other decisions from time to time. The mini-games are a timed exercise of putting puzzle pieces together, and a card-matching game against two female opponents."
"Akazukin Cha-Cha: Osawagase! Panic Race!","","NTSC-J","","NEC Home Electronics, Ltd.","NEC Home Electronics","1996-10-25","6","No","Board","Not Rated","The game is based on the manga Akazukin Cha-Cha (""Red Riding Hood Cha-Cha"") by Min Ayahana, and subsequently on the animated TV series that followed it. The manga tells the story of a little girl named Cha-Cha who lives with her teacher on a mountain and studies magic. In the anime, the story was expanded to include the villainous Demon King, whom Cha-Cha and her best friend Riiya, a werewolf boy, must eventually defeat.

Akazukin Cha-Cha: Osawagase! Panic Race! is a board game for up to six players. Each player corresponds to a character from the TV series. It is also possible to play just as Cha-Cha and to let the AI control the other characters. Each player advances on the board by throwing dice. Landing on different fields leads to different results: finding items, being attacked, etc. The game's strategy elements are expanded by giving each character unique statistics and abilities, that have to be used under special circumstances. Certain obstacles are only solvable if two or more characters gather on the same field.

Taking a cue from Battle Heat, ""Akazukin Cha-Cha"" accompanies every single move by an anime-style FMV."
"Albarea no Otome","","NTSC-J","","NEC Home Electronics, Ltd.","Gimmick House","1997-06-27","1","No","Strategy","Not Rated","In Albarea no Otome you play one of the three girls who were summoned to the castle of the Queen of Albarea to study fighting and magical arts (you can name your heroine as you like). As an additional reward - beside the graduation - you can try to impress and ultimately to win the heart of one of the five great knights of the kingdom. Your goal in the game is to make sure you become stronger and more charming than your two rivals, and to make a good impression on the Queen and the knights.

You must plan a schedule for your studies in castle. You can choose which classes to visit and which not. Learning increases your abilities (for example, attending magic class will make your spells more powerful). Once in a while you'll have to help one of the knights to fight monsters. The battles take place on an isometric battle field, on which you can freely move your characters and attack or use spells when there are enemies in range. Your goal in battles is not only to win, but to make sure the heroine does some attacking instead of letting the powerful knights do the job."

There are no changes gameplay-wise (a mixture of adventure, strategy, and dating sim) or story-wise (a simple girl named Angelique Limoges must befriend nine Guardians to become a queen). This version features slightly improved graphics, CD-quality music, voice acting, and anime-style cutscenes."

Now a whole new Cosmos has appeared, and it's time to choose a new queen for it. The candidates this time are Angelique Collet (the protagonist of the game) and Rachel Hart.

The gameplay system remains largely unchanged in this sequel. Once again, Angelique has to use diplomacy to make the Nine Guardians lend her their powers (making the inhabitants of her land happy), or develop stronger feelings for her. New in this sequel is the ability to work with three different instructors, developing mind, sense, or dignity of the heroine, which will influence the way she interacts with other characters and also affect the behavior of the Guardians."

Along with a PC-FX game catalogue, a live-action video involving Japanese ""idols"", information about shopping for PC-FX products, a geographical database along a Japanese railway route, and a preview of the upcoming Last Imperial Prince, this volume contains the opening chapter of an anime mini-series entitled Prism Knights, its plot focusing on a group of high school girls who gain access to powerful transformation abilities in order to face evil extraterrestrial beings."

A demo of Akazukin Cha-Cha: Osawagase! Panic Race!
A slide show of photos of voice actresses
A karaoke mode for some of the songs used in PC-FX titles
A collection of movies dedicated to Lilith, the heroine of Megami Tengoku II
PC-FX-related news
""Voice Idol"" mode, which contains information about songs used in PC-FX games
The first episode of an anime mini-series called ""Private Eye Doll""
A ""Making Of..."" section.
What still allows this CD to qualify as a game is the fact that it also contains a rock-paper-scissors mini-game, which is played against a real actress. The player has to press one of the three main PC-FX controller buttons in time, which correspond to the international hand gestures for rock, paper, and scissors."

and finally what justifies calling this compilation a game: a card-based mini-game called ""High and Low"", which is played against a real actress. The actress deals a card, and the player must guess whether the next card will be higher or lower within a time limit. Guessing correctly will give the player a star, which will be accumulated at the top left corner of the screen. Guessing wrong pushes the player back to the beginning of the game, so what really matters is winning as many times as possible in a row, gathering stars in the process."

The player is shown 10 boxes, only one of which contains the heart. The player and the actress take turns in guessing where the heart might be. Each turn has a time limit of 10 seconds. The box can either contain the heart, be empty, or have a ""Chance"" icon inside, which will grant an additional turn."
"Anime Freak FX: Vol.5","","NTSC-J","","NEC Home Electronics, Ltd.","HuneX","1997-08-29","1","No","Utility","Not Rated","The fifth installment of the series brings back mini-games, and this time with something far more challenging than the simple luck-based games from the first three volumes: a quiz game. The quiz is all about NEC's two consoles, PC Engine (TurboGrafx) and PC-FX, ranging from game-related to technical questions. Not only does this quiz require extensive knowledge of the consoles, but it is also timed.

Other than this quiz, Vol. 5 contains most of the regular stuff seen before (Making Of, anime database, etc. - without the karaoke mode this time though). It continues the anime mini-series Prism Knights from the previous volume. It also has full walkthroughs for several PC-FX games.

Vol. 5 takes a decisive step towards less kid-friendly approach: it contains a large collection of videos of various anime-style girls (from PC-FX games or otherwise) changing clothes. There is no explicit nudity, but it comes close! This volume also has videos of voice actresses in bikini on a beach and in an amusement park."
"Anime Freak FX: Vol.6","","NTSC-J","","NEC Home Electronics, Ltd.","HuneX","1998-02-27","1","No","Utility","Not Rated","The final volume of Anime Freak returns, so to say, to the roots of the series: instead of slightly naughty videos of scantily clad young women (real or drawn in anime style), it focuses on actual game-related material. Unfortunately, by that time PC-FX was nearly extinct, so Vol. 6 contains a trailer for only one game - one last game for PC-FX: First Kiss Story. It also lacks many of the features available in other issues of Anime Freak, such as karaoke mode, news section, or walkthroughs. It concludes the mini-anime series Prism Knights and Kodomo no Omocha, started in previous two issues. New material available in this volume includes interviews with voice actors, as well as a detailed video about working in recording studios.

The game in this volume is the same as in the first volume (albeit against a different actress), namely ""Rock, Paper, Scissors""."

And once again, the benevolent and gorgeous goddess Swatty is here to provide assistance, together with her side-kicks, the Seven Lucky Gods from the Japanese mythology.

Even though the story is pretty much the same as in the previous game, the gameplay underwent significant enhancements. The interface is still traditional Japanese-style menu commands, but there are many more locations now, many of which can be freely accessed by clicking on them while on the main map. Once the player has reached the point where he can begin the physical seduction of the girl, the interface switches to point-and-click, with context-sensitive cursor for touching, kissing, etc. It is necessary to try different actions more than once to understand what the girl considers pleasant and what not, otherwise the girl might get angry and the game will be over. There are many more girls to seduce here than in the previous game, ranging from a school girl to a Catholic nun (seriously). There are also various extras (as the title implies), including an extensive album that arranges various pictures of the girls so that they tell her story, and an additional collection of stories, in which the hero can learn more about the girls he had met in the main game, and even interact with them again."

The one to execute that order would be none other than Luru’s brother, Lunoa. He attempted to convince Luru to return, but perhaps out of love for his sister, he didn’t act fast enough to stop her when she refused.

In order to become successful, she has to do more than just draw well; it is important to develop other aspects of her personality, and also keep an eye on the finances, otherwise working too much might deteriorate her drawing skills. Social life, physical exercises, reading - everything has consequences!

The gameplay consists mainly of making decisions (through menu choices); there is no player character navigation in the game, except shops, which are viewed from first-person perspective. There is a variety of ways to manage the girl's life. The player can make a schedule for a whole month, or decide every day what to do. Every action has an effect on the heroine's parameters. For example, just resting every day reduces physical shape and appeal. Working on the manga increases respective skills. It is possible to call friends and spend time with them, or go shopping. There are many items in the game, all of which influence the heroine's stats in that or another way - for example clothes, drawing accessories, books, or even a PC-FX console, that can be bought in an electronics store for about 20000 yen."

Yes, you've guessed it - the hero (and by extension, the player) can conquer the hearts of all three, plus a dozen more lovely girls that populate the city of Akitsuki - and that is pretty much what the story is about.

First Kiss Story is what is commonly called a ""visual novel"", with even less interaction than a typical Japanese adventure with its menu-based commands. All the player can do here is to access locations from the town map, and sometimes choose a dialogue option. The locations with a ""girl event"" in them are marked with a heart on the map. Depending on the decisions taken by the player, the hero will end up with one of the pretty girls.

Despite suggestive themes and some mildly erotic images, there is no nudity in this game.

There are no visible dice, but the amount of fields Angelique can walk on is determined randomly by clicking on the ""move"" button. Fields can either be empty, placed inside a location (like Angelique's own room), trigger events, conversations, etc. In some places it is possible to find items, which can then be used on another field to help Angelique advance more quickly, increasing her chances to become the queen."

You determine their class schedules, do guidance counseling, interfere with their weekend plans, and occasionally take to the streets to make sure they're not getting into trouble. Each of the girls have their own individual personality and problems, and the choices you make will determine whether they graduate from high school, what they do with their lives afterwards, and whether or not they wind up hating your guts. Get them all into top colleges and your boss will praise your genius. If they all flunk or wind up wanting to marry you, you'll obviously be fired.

Despite what common sense and knowledge of the Japanese psyche might lead you to believe, this is not an adult (or hentai) game and there's no nudity and only an average amount of anime sexploitation."

The game follows the story of the anime since the first episode. It is set in an alternate universe, following a fictional story of a real historical character, admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (1884 -1943), the commander of the Japanese fleet during World War II. In reality, he was killed during a plane attack by American forces. However, in the anime (and the game) he is miraculously transported on board of the ship Nisshin, shortly after the battle of Tsushima, in 1905. Afterwards, he uses his knowledge from the future to make sure that Japan will be the most powerful country in the world.

The game re-creates the pseudo-historical battles against USA during the alternate World War II, such as depicted in the anime. It is a turn-based strategy game with heavy emphasis on naval combat.

It has virtually no story and relies entirely on exploration and strategic combat. Set in a medieval world with little to no distinguishing characteristics, ""Lunatic Dawn"" throws the player immediately into the game world, which is open for him to explore. The player is able to choose the main character's gender, race (human, elf, etc.), class, and even age - older characters are more powerful, but have a more limited play time.

Indeed, the entire gameplay process is timed. Traveling to a remote city or dungeon can take up to several game days. The player has to provide sufficient food for his party during this time. Player party consists of pre-generated characters, who have different names and belong to different races and classes, but have virtually no personality. Food and other supplies can be acquired in towns, through which the player moves in a Wizardry-like fashion - viewing locations from first-person perspective and selecting menu commands.

When the party enters a dungeon, the view switches to isometric. The dungeons are large and maze-like, with enemies visible on screen. Upon contact with an enemy, a battle initiates. The battles are turn-based but fast-paced, reminding somewhat the Infinity Engine battles from Baldur's Gate series. The participants can freely move on the battle field. The player directly controls only the main characters, but can assign general commands to the party members."

The player navigates his favorite shrine maiden through the vast top-down world of Megami Paradise, trying to recruit as many people as possible on their side. The girls can talk to people using different approaches (sweet, passionate, etc.). They can buy a variety of items to increase their parameters and hence their appeal factor to the average citizen. Changing clothes also helps sometimes. There are also some battles, which utilize a slot machine system, and other mini-games.
